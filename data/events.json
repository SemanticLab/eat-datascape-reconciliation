        "text": "Transmuted reverie of Vietnam war photos, fury; drawings, notes-- beginning of \"Snows: In September Paul Libin calls to offer the use of the Martinique Theater for a new work. I don't want a stage or theater for \"Snows:. Libin interested in other spaces too.\r\nLook for a barge or boat to perform on (in the night, to be riding out into the Hudson... \"Snows:. beyond the three mile limit.') No boats.\r\nRuins. Spend three weeks exploring ruins in the city with Libin. Unable to get a permit to assemble an audience. All complications interfering with flow of imagery which attaches itself to each fantastic configuration of rubble and decay which cannot be utilized.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRehearsals explore: crawls, grabs and falls, passing women, creation of faces (strobe), body sculpture (film projections), projections on women with snow?, body ball and pusher, crawl and capture, dragging bodies, hung up bodies, foil bodies (cocoons and walkers), rescue of walkers, body pile Viet-Flakes snowing.\r\nEnvironment: some sort of huge flexible lens with prismatic properties; all actions, film projections to be enlarged, distorted, reflected by lens? Four suspended panels on which films ;will be projected (as well as on walls collaged white, ceiling). All subject to dominance of lens. Three planks which lead from performance area across seats into audience. Collapsible table for raised body groupings and film projections. Cut open stage, cover with transparent plexiglass, light from below. Two vertical light machines, eight feet high, behind lense, next to suspended panels: revolving lights, shooting light to be controlled by contact mikes set under certain seats in the audience. (Robert Schultz's color organ operated by sound source). Movement of audience in their seats will be amplified through contact mikes and control dimming and raising of certain lights.\r\nEarly in the morning, Schultz, Warshaw, Tenney and I drive station wagon out to Bell Labs. Lightly snowing. Robbie takes us to old house in New Providence which serves as storage for E.A.T. materials and is in itself a complex environment I would like to use. Bitterly cold. Picking and choosing like crazy in Woolworths: these transistors, those cables, these SCRs... the stuff all looks very junky, mute and utterly unrelated to the images it will go to realize. (They tell me we've picked $4000 worth. Libin has set entire \"Snows\" budget at $400 which we exceed as it turns out). Station wagon jammed with plastic boxes, cable, wire, power amplifiers, transceivers, photo[-]resistors, tone controls, preamps, mikes, contact mikes, speaker matrix, huge speakers, motors, string! We can barely squeeze ourselves back in. The guys happy as monkeys surrounded by bananas; I'm brooding. The mechanical materials have a buried character; working parts all covered-- the boxing doesn't indicate the interesting things inside. These objects have a sub-visual domination over immediate time and space. All mysterious promise. Not mal[l]eable. (Unlike taking of hunk of plastic in my hands, some living arms and legs, a cranky projector with a fine shape. A preposterous journey about to unfold and where was controlling center after all)?\r\nMagnifying lens would be impossible expense (Polymer dome!) Decided to try plastic bags filled with water, lit from behind. Plan to hang them. Discover their size, weight of water, prohibit hanging. Spend a week learning about industrial plastic bags. We'll have to build a structure, floor to ceiling cage to support bags. Peter Watts and Karl Schenzer will build it. No longer possible to keep \"water lens\" In center of performing area-- three sided stage exacts compr[o]mise; lens set toward back of stage, leave several sections without bags so that we can crawl in and out.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTell Robbie Robinson we have special problems asso[cia]ted with use of E.A.T. equipment; each person now involved in technical realizations has very specialized, individuals work\r\nto do and I need help with over-all technical coordinations which need to be appar[e]nt to the performers; Warshaw and Schultz need assistance with their ideas which are complex, involving labor which could exceed time left to us. Robinson sent two technicians from Bell Labs, who had worked in the Armory Show. Per Biorn heard all our troubles while astride the water-lens structure- which he tested for strength - zapping practical solutions to us. He devised a gear system and perfected mechanical construction for Warshaw's light sculpture.\r\nRobbie also sent us Ralph Flynn who came to the Martinique shortly after we had sorted E.A.T.'s equipment and found much of it damaged. Watching him handle a broken preamp I saw we had a \"master\" (\"and I'm so young\" he said.) As Robbie had promised, \"Flynn will take care of everything he worked with us contin[u]ously.' The \"everything\" had to encompass an enormous range of details-- mechanical, aesthetic, practical, visionary. His help was especially invaluable to me because of his own experience with theater while a student. At this point we had only two weeks until performance (Paul Libin had generously kept the theater empty for three weeks while we constructed, rehearsed \"Snows\"), the technical possibilities of the equipment we now had was. generating ideas which we could take months to realize. I had to insist that we concentrate on what was immediate and possible, to give up many past and new ideas. Ralph assisted me in this crucial sorting. (Light and sound systems, special machines, strobes, films, environment and action were in the relationship I wanted before performance and everyone had time to feel free, clear and aware of the over-all rhythm of \"Snows\".) Fortunately my own metaphoric collage process with all materials-- which meant many changes and variations, was a matter of course to Flynn. It was finally, always necessary for me to see a thing to know if it was really what was needed; since each element transformed any other once it was visible or audible entire relationships would be shifted.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMy problems with technology are concrete, personal; my difficulties with using technicians are mechanical. I want to work with the gestures of machines; to expose their mechanical action as part of any total environment to which it contribut[e]s its particular effect. I would like technicians to be interchang[e]able with performers wherever possible. The work of the technicians should become one other action parameter of my work, to be taken into the form of the whole thing explicit[l]y. For myself this means greater familiarity with possibilities of available technology and time to explore: a diet of E.A.T.",

        "text": "\"Snows\", performed at the Martinique Theater from January 21, 1967 to February 5 involved primarily audio and visual techniques. A color organ was used to trigger lights on Laurence Warshaw's color machine. This color organ was activated either manually or by sounds produced by the actors on stage. Silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR's) were used on most of the overhead stage lighting, and some were triggered by photocells picking up various light changes. Several of the audience seats were wired with contact mikes which picked up random noises from the audience movement and were fed to the speakers placed around the theater. Some of the noises were also fed to the color organ and SCR units. Strobes and movie projectors were used throughout the piece. All audio was controlled by a speaker distribution matrix which enabled us to distribute as many as twenty inputs into any of twenty audio outputs. A tape recorder was used for special music and background effects.",

He had received an offer to build a sculpture in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art. I asked Tinguely, \"What do you need?\" His answer was, \"bicycle wheels.\" We gathered the material from bicycle shops in New Jersey and the garbage dumps on the New Jersey flats. It took us three weeks to build what he wanted, a self-destructing machine. With the help of my friends at Bell Telephone Laboratories, we constructed timing and triggering devices to release smoke, start a fire in a piano, break support members, and make noises.",

        "text": "When Jean first told me about his idea for a self-destructive machine, he wanted a large assembly hall on Manhattan. The machine would do all kinds of wild things and finally destroy itself. A chicken-wire netting would save the audience from a similar fate. But The Museum of Modern Art came into the picture and offered Jean its Sculpture Garden as the site, and the dome to work in.\r\nThe first drawings of the machine show little resemblance to the final result. A meta-matic painting machine was there. It would create a continuously changing painting that would disappear as the paper was rolled up again into a tight roll. A text of dirty words would unfold. A Virgin Mary was to be sawed in half. Parts of the machine would tip over, others would finally collapse as dozens of saws attacked the steel construction. The noise would be terrific.\r\nThe beginning was slow. Jean bought old motors in the bizarre Canal Street shops. A weather balloon and smoke signals (that did not work) were found in a surplus store. He collected steel tubing for the structure and tools to work with. Pulleys were expensive. He wanted old bicycle wheels from junk yards. But no junk yard in the U.S. deals in such trivialities. I stumbled onto a dealer in Plainfield who was clearing out his basement and carried away 35 old rusty wheels. Jean was as excited as a child when we brought the wheels through the empty museum that evening. The dome was unheated, and the temperature was below freezing, but things began to move. \"I want more wheels,\" he said.\r\nThe next day my wife and I raided the Summit dump. This was a gold mine. We loaded the car and parked it behind the fence on 54th Street. A child' s potty and bassinet, the drum from a washing machine, and 25 more baby carriages and bicycle wheels were thrown over the fence. The Saturday-afternoon passers-by raised the inevitable question: \"What' s going on here?\" On the other side of the fence, Jean was laughing.\r\nThe following day the first structure was almost finished. It contained a large meta-matic with the pot, the bassinet, and the drum as percussion elements. A nut beat on the pot, a clamp jumped up and down in the bassinet, and a fan motor attacked the drum. The paper would unfold from a horizontal roll at the top and be guided down on a sheet-metal trough. Here it would be printed on by an elaborate arm that Jean later worked on for two days until it was perfect. At the bottom of the structure, the continuously moving paper would be blown toward the audience by a fan. The machine was taking form.\r\nJean and I made another trip to the dump. This time it was the Newark city dump, which is as much a reflection of the general neighborhood as is the Summit dump. This large dump was Jean's world. He kept finding the oddest objects and formations. Spilled- out paint would make a painting to be exhibited in some fashionable gallery. Someone had left a complete bedroom suite. If he could find a willing girl (which he admitted would be difficult), this would be place where he would like to live. \"I could, you know,\" he said. He would spend his days in the dump as a completely free man. Out of the debris he would build large, involved constructions. Slowly he would convince the bums, living in small shacks on the dump, that what he was making was important. Eventually they would join him and help him build. Of course, art was never to be mentioned, and his constructions would never be anything else but part of the dump. [p.158] It is against the background of the anarchy and chaos of the Newark city dump that I see the growth of his machine.\r\nThe bums did indeed help us, and we walked away with a cable drum, American flags, a rusty oil can, and more baby-carriage wheels, of which for some reason there were plenty. Jean kept saying constantly: \"We can put anything into the machine.\" In the final analysis, this of course was not true. As we were going back with our load, Jean behaved like a tourist seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. To him the landscape was extremely beautiful.\r\nJean was now going at a fantastic rate. But the dome was cold, and he became ill with fever. This did not stop him, however, and he called anxiously for the insides of an old piano and a radio. I was lucky. A piano dealer in the neighborhood of the museum had an old piano. \"Ten dollars if you come and get it.\" For two dollars, Jean brought an old Addressograph machine from the Museum.\r\nOn the piano he mounted about ten arms made up of old bicycle parts. These arms hit the keys of the piano like the players of a player piano. Attached to the piano was another meta-matic, a smaller one with a sponge on the painting arm. The paper came down and was again rolled into a tight roll. L'art \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re. There were two texts that would roll by like the news bulletins on Times Square. One was vertical, and one was horizontal. \"Je fais l'angle droit, tu sais,\" he boasted. Rising above the structure was a 25-foot- high steel tube that would support the weather balloon at the top. An old wooden radio was attached to the side of the piano and was sawed in half by a large handsaw. The whole section with the piano and the second meta-matic had dozens of wheels in it for the various operations.\r\nThe Addressograph machine was transformed into a percussion machine with cans and a big bell. It made a fantastic noise. As the big motor of the machine worked, a lever stuck under the machine would be pulled in, and the machine would fall over. This system was never tried out.\r\nDuring the last days, he made two small carriages powered by their own motors. One had a giant motor and a two-foot Klaxon sitting on two baby-carriage wheels and a small pulley. This was to be placed under the piano and would at a certain moment escape, dragging odd objects behind it. The second moving contraption was a very odd thing. Jean' s idea was that it would move to the side and fall into the pool of the garden. It would commit suicide. The carriage was made up of a cable drum, more wheels, and an oil can. Sticking above it was a rod to which a corner of an American flag was attached. Two nights before the set evening, we tried it out in the museum. It was a strange sight to see this wonderful creation move laboriously in the empty museum halls. As it moved, an arm tapped a march rhythm on the empty can, and the red and white piece of the flag waved back and forth furiously. Stunned spectators looked through the windows on 53rd Street at the weird and beautiful spectacle.\r\nDestruction seemed less and less an element of the machine. The saws were replaced by joints that would break as the metal of which they were made was melted by the heat from overheated resistors. Thus the original steel tubing was sawed through, and these joints were attached to support the structure. Jean seemed happy not to have to worry about the saws, but the joints never became quite a real part of his structure. As the first meta-matic collapsed, it would fall backward. The piano, placed on a frame two feet above ground, would itself fall backward into the fallen meta-matic. The second meta-matic and the support for the balloon would be dragged along in the fall of the piano. Behind the wooden boards, Jean mounted a carbon-dioxide fire extinguisher, concealed by wooden boards. As a lever was pulled, the extinguisher would empty itself with a big swoosh. At the same time, the bell on the Addressograph would begin to ring.\r\nNothing was to be touched during the operation of the machine. The various functions and elements were to be started by pre-set time-delay relays. Everything was elaborately wired mechanically and electrically. Even a flame that would burn on the piano was to [p.159] be lighted electrically. All over the structure were smoke flashes and yellow smoke signals which would be started without direct interference. This combination of electrical and mechanical control gave Jean a great freedom to develop his machine.\r\nAn involved gear system would slowly turn the piano on. After a few minutes, a bucket of gasoline would be overturned onto the flame, a burning candle, so that the gasoline would catch fire. Another mechanical arrangement in the first meta-matic turned three beer cans filled with paint onto the paper rolling down toward the audience. On the very top of the first structure was a trough in which gallon-sized boUles would slide down as they were pushed by a lever. When they crashed to the ground, nauseating smells would spread. A child's go-cart would be pushed back and forth in front of the structure. There must have even about a hundred different operations in the machine.\r\nNot until the last days did Jean decide to paint his machine all white. He seemed fascinated with this color but was a little worried that the machine would look too beautiful. The only counterpoint seemed to be the balloon that would explode and hang disgustingly over the piano. The two texts were composed the night before the event on the first floor of the museum. The night-watchmen, late museum employees - everybody helped.\r\nOn the day of destruction, the temperature rose above freezing for the first time. It was slushy, and the St. Patrick's Day parade was braving the rain on Fifth Avenue. When I arrived in the morning, the museum workmen, usually accustomed to hanging delicate paintings, were struggling to get the machine out of the dome and down to the Sculpture Garden. It was slippery, and things broke. The Addressograph was damaged, and Jean became tense. At one moment I thought he was going to quit it all. But nothing could break his resources of energy, and toward the afternoon his excitement transmitted itself to everyone. The workmen were now breaking their back to get things in order. The museum had given him cart blanche, and everything Jean wanted he got. The rain stopped.\r\nRobert Rauschenberg, who had promised a mascot for the machine, showed up with an object called a money-thrower. When some powder in an open box was lighted, the thrust would release two springs in which he had stuck a dozen silver dollars. Rauschenberg waited for hours to have his money-thrower connected.\r\nEarlier in the morning, I had finally got hold of various stinking liquids, which I put in the bottles. Jean had already rejected the use of nitrogen butyl mercaptan, or the stink of a skunk, in spite of the fact that he had demanded the strongest stenches I could find. I had also found out how to make a thick white smoke. Since several other methods had failed us, I did not emphasize to Jean what I had found, but simply asked him if I could put it in the bassinet. He said O.K.\r\nThe Klaxon did not work. Robert Breer went for a wild last- minute chase for a 6-volt Klaxon and found one that he actually tore off an old car. No new one would do. By then he was so wet and dirty that no taxi would take him back to the museum.\r\nThe public arrived, but nobody noticed it. Jean was fixing the meta-matics. putting on the smoke flashes, and directing everybody else. Not until 6 o'clock did I get a power line to the machine. All the circuits were connected. By accident, Robert Breer turned on the fire extinguisher in the piano. The secret had been revealed, but nobody understood what had happened. I discovered that one leg on the first structure was not sawed through. I was a real irony that the last thing we did was to saw this leg off. If it had been left, the structure would presumably not have collapsed and fallen over.",

        "text": "The public arrived, but nobody noticed it. Jean was fixing the meta-matics putting on the smoke flashes, and directing everybody else.

I was a real irony that the last thing we did was to saw this leg off. If it had been left, the structure would presumably not have collapsed and fallen over.\r\nAt 7:30 I was finished. \" On va?\" \"On va,\" said Jean. He looked as calm as if he were about to take a bus. Not once did we go over and check everything. The construction and the beginning of the destruction were indistinguishable. Bob Breer put the titanium tetrachloride in the bassinet, a friend who had helped me with the circuits put in the plug, and I set the relays. The machine was off. It was launched as it was constructed. Jean was in complete charge [p.160] of his work. The piano was to begin playing slowly as the flame on the keyboard was lighted. But the step-up transformer had broken in transport, so the motor had to be started directly at full speed. The result was that the driving sling jumped the wheel on the piano as the motor started. I went cold. No piano! Nervously, I tried to put on the sling. \"Laisse-moi faire, Billy,\" I heard .Jean's voice say calmly. A fuse had blown. It was fixed. The piano was working again, but only three notes were playing - three sad notes. Some slings had been lost. I saw nothing but the machine. The audience was invisible.\r\nAfter three minutes, the first meta-matic went on. But Jean had reversed the sling so the paper was rolling up instead of down. It was a bizarre effect. Earlier he had with great care put the paper in order and fixed the arm. The audience must have expected a lot from this machine. To make the situation more incredible, the motor driving the arm had not been reconnected. Thus, even if Jean had put the sling on correctly, the meta-matic would not have worked, and the empty paper would have rolled down the trough. Jean was laughing as he always did when something exciting happened. Meta-matic No. 21 produced a three-foot-long painting as the beer cans emptied on to the paper rolling in the wrong direction. And the arm he had worked on to perfection did not function. But the fan at the bottom of the structure was not without use. The smoke was coming out thick and white from the bassinet, and the fan blew it toward the audience. Ladies with mink coats who were sitting in the cafeteria could not see because of the smoke. The percussion elements were working fine.\r\nIn the sixth minute, the radio went on. Nobody could hear it because of the noise. The gasoline bucket was turned over the flame and the piano started burning. Rauschenberg' s money-thrower went off in a big flash. The silver dollars were never seen again. The fan motor started to beat on the drum from the washing machine. But the bottles did not fall. Jean had put in too weak a string. Why? After all our haggle over the stinks! But the only thing that annoyed Jean was that the balloon did not burst. The compressed air bottle was empty. The little two-wheeled cart in front of the meta-matic started to move back and forth.\r\nIn the tenth minute, the second meta-matic started and worked beautifully. It made a black painting streak with the sponge on its arm. The horizontal text went on. Something was wrong with it. It was winding up too slowly. Jean came by: \" Do vou remember the little ring you picked up and asked what it was for? It was to hold the paper roll up.\" Meanwhile, the vertical text was finished and the end of the paper was flying over the burning piano.\r\nJean was walking around calmly. He stopped in front of the machine and let the photographers take pictures, posing like an actor. As he was standing there the text \"Yinq is Yang\" appeared on the horizontal text roll. On the photographs of him with his self- destroying machine in the background, this sentence can be read above his head.\r\nIn the eighteenth minute, the fire extinguisher in the piano was supposed to go off. It didn't. The simple reason was that the piano was no burning all the way through, and the rubber hose had burnt up clogged the extinguisher. But the suicide carriage rolled off some ten feet. The motor was so weak that Jean had to help it along. It would never have made it to the pool anyway, and Jean knew this all along. But he never exchanged the weak motor for a stronger one, which would have been a simple operation. As a functional object, the suicide carriage was supposed to move; as a work of art, it wasn't. This was typical of Jean's relation to the motor. On other places in the machine, there were big motors that did practically nothing; and in one place, he used a motor as a counter weight! The motor was Jean part of sculpture.\r\nThe Addressograph machine began to work. The yellow smoke signal was lighted and the arms banged on the empty oil cans. The bell had never been put into operation. It turned out to be a gong that strikes only once. The whole machine was somewhat sick after [p.161] the bad handling in transport, and it fell over after only a few minutes. In the twentieth minute, the resistors in the first structure were connected. After a few minutes the metal had melted, and the whole structure sagged, but it never collapsed completely and fell over. The reason was that the crossbars that held up the wheels were strong enough to keep the structure together. But the smoke flashes were lighted by the heat of the resistors. In the twenty-third minute, the little carriage shot out from under the piano with terrific speed. Its Klaxon was working fine, and it ended up in a ladder on which the Paris-Match correspondent was standing. He turned it around, and it continued into the NBC sound equipment. Smoke and flames were coming out of its end.\r\nThe fire in the piano was rapidly spreading. At one point, Jean had tried to damp it with an extinguisher. Now the flames had eaten their way through the piano, and Jean suddenly became afraid that the extinguisher on the back of the piano might explode from the heat. He told me to get the fireman to put out the fire.\r\nThe fireman had been there all afternoon. When the fire on the piano started, I was standing next to him. He did not react, and maybe he was enjoying the spectacle. He later called up the fire department. My wife overheard him trying to explain what was going on: \"You see, Joe, there is this fire .... \" It was evidently decided that the fire in the piano was not a fire. Jean called him a \"the\u0301oriticien de feu.\"\r\nWhen I realized what Jean was saying, I tried to explain the situation to the fireman. He did not understand me when I talked about an extinguisher in the piano. The first fire extinguisher from the museum arrived. The fireman was very calm, as if nothing were happening. After three minutes, the longest in my life, they finally began to put out the fire. Even then the fireman was reluctant to do so because of the electrical wiring. At this point, both Jean and I were almost desperate but the audience apparently got the wrong impression of what was happening. They thought the fireman was the one who wanted to put out the fire, and that we were trying to prevent him. They almost lynched the poor man who brought the extinguisher. A giant misunderstanding had developed, in which only the fireman seemed untouched by the confusion. He told me later that, of course, fire extinguishers are not made so that they blow up from heat. There had been no danger whatsoever. The fireman liked the show, he said.\r\nThe fire was damped and Bob Breer courageously knocked the supporting pieces of wood from under the piano. Jean had not dared to use the automatic system because of the bad effects from the transport. The piano collapsed backward but did not fall over.\r\nI separated the fire extinguisher from the piano, and the public descended on the remains for souvenirs. They walked away with the radio, the saw, the meta-matic drawings, and lots of other things. Later the structure was dragged down into a pile of scrap that looked incredible. The bottles broke, so that the garden stank for two days. The junk was carried back to the dump the next day. Only a few mementos survived. The battered Addressograph machine was given to a photographer from the museum, who hauled it away at great expense. It will stand and rust in his garden. The suicide carriage was given to the museum, Bob Breer got a funny wheel construction that had early been put out of operation by the eager audience, and the small carriage with the big motor and the Klaxon stands under my table. All the rest was memory and pictures.",

        "text": "In the same way as a scientific experiment can never fail, this experiment in art could never tai! The machine was not a functional object and was never treated like one. The spectacle can therefore not be judged in terms of whether this or that thing did not work. During the construction of the machine, I was constantly amazed at Jean' s disregard for the simplest rules of engineering. In one instant he would demand that something should function, and in the next he would violate his demand by the most trivial of actions. Jean worked as an artist. He chose his motors and put on his slings as an artist. He was interested only in functional operations that he could understand, so that he could reject or accept them as he pleased. [p.162] But he was also inspired by possibilities of engineering and realized he could use them as long as he was in complete control of what he was doing. As an engineer, working with him, I was part of the machine. This new availability was largely responsible for the size and complexity of the machine.\r\nJean' s machine was conceived out of \" total anarchy and freedom,\" as he put it. The free and chaotic circumstances under which it was built were a necessity and, in a way, a tremendous luxury. Jean supplied the energy to create the freedom and was ruler over the chaos. When the energy was released, everything that happened was related to some of Jean's decisions. No distinction can be made between the\" random\" elements, the accidents, or the controlled parts of the spectacle. It was created in its totality out of freedom and innocence. The bottles that did not fall, the paper roll that rotated in the wrong direction, the fireman and the audience were all part of the same spectacle. There could exist no paradox, no question, no  \"nonsense,\" no a priority, and no chaos in this spectacle. It was a definite demonstration, made with love and humor, and not a philosophical problem.\r\nI do not interpret the self-destruction of Jean's machine as an act of protest against the machine, or an expression of nihilism and despair, as some critics have suggested. The self-destruction or self-elimination of the machine is an ideal of good machines and human beings, this is an obvious truth. This idea has already been expressed by Claude Shannon in the\" Little Black Box,\" in which, when you pull a switch, a lid opens and a hand emerges that throws the switch in the off position whereupon the lid closes again over the hand.\r\nJust as in every moment we see and experience a new and changing world, Jean's machine created and destroyed itself as a representation of a moment in our lives. The art of the museum is related to a past time that we cannot see and feel again. The artist has already left his canvas behind. This art then becomes part of our inherited language, and thus has a relation to our world different than the reality of the immediate now. L'art e\u0301phe\u0301me\u0300re, on the other hand, creates a direct connection between the creative act of the artist and the receptive act of the audience, between the construction and the destruction. It forces us out of the inherited image and into contact with ever-changing reality. In one of Jean's \"manifestes.\" he says that we shall \"be static with movement.\" We must be the creative masters of changing reality - which we are, by the definition of Man. The parts from which Jean's machine were built came from the chaos of the dump and were returned to the dump.\r\nJean kept saying that he was constantly thinking about New York as his machine took form. There are probably many connections, the most obvious one being a machine that has rejected itself and become humor and poetry. New York has humor and poetry, in spite of the presence of the machine, whereas in a purely technocratic society the machine must always be a functional object. Failures of the machine can therefore never be allowed, because control is the necessary element of that society. It is when the machine must function at any cost that there can be no \"Homage to New York.\"",

Commen\u00e7ai Oracle, une sculpture en cinq morceaux avec une source sonore et son contr\u00f4le s\u00e9par\u00e9s [sic]. Collaborateur Billy Kl\u00fcver; assist\u00e9 par Harold Hodges. Oracle interrompu par Dylaby \u00e0 Amsterdam. Finis Oracle, 1965.\" (2) Oracle est l'aboutissement d'une recherche sur les collages sonores, contrepoints des collages visuels de l'artiste (ses \"combine paintings\" compos\u00e9s de fragments de bois, de tissus, de s\u00e9rigraphies, etc.). La premi\u00e8re r\u00e9alisation fut Broadcast en 1959, \"combine painting\" dans laquelle furent incorpor\u00e9s des postes de radio. puis, \u00e0 Washington, en 1963, Rauschenberg utilisa un poste de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, la radio et des enregistrements pour sa premi\u00e8re oeuvre de th\u00e9\u00e2tre/danse, Pelican. Plus tard, il lan\u00e7a E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology) qui devait \"fonctionner comme un catalyseur pour op\u00e9rer l'in\u00e9vitable fusion des sp\u00e9cialisations qui cr\u00e9ent un homme responsable travaillant dans le temps pr\u00e9sent.\" (2) Pour Rauschenberg l'artiste devait collaborer avec l'ing\u00e9nieur pour r\u00e9aliser un art de notre temps. Trois ans d'exp\u00e9rimentations ininterrompues avec Billy Kl\u00fcver aboutirent \u00e0 Oracle. A l'origine c'\u00e9tait un raccourci de New York : les \u00e9l\u00e9ments proviennent de b\u00e2timents de la ville, en voie de d\u00e9gradation comme la ville elle-m\u00eame, et les r\u00e9cepteurs plac\u00e9s dans chacune des pi\u00e8ces captaient toutes les longueurs d'onde des radios new-yorkaises, en passant sans cesse d'une station \u00e9mettrice \u00e0 l'autre. Un moteur permet de balayer les longueurs d'onde \u00e0 une vitesse variable, t\u00e9l\u00e9command\u00e9e par le spectateur, de m\u00eame que le volume. Plac\u00e9e d\u00e9sormais dans une autre ville, l'oeuvre peut \u00eatre comprise comme un concentr\u00e9 de la vie urbaine. Au Centre Pompidou les postes re\u00e7oivent toutes les stations de la Tch\u00e9koslovaquie \u00e0 l'Irlande, de Milan \u00e0 Hambourg. La cacophonie qui en r\u00e9sulte est la voix m\u00eame de la cit\u00e9 dans laquelle tous les bruits interf\u00e8rent en un m\u00e9lange al\u00e9atoire.\r\n\r\n(1) Pontus Hulten, catalogue de l'exposition The Machine as seen at the end of the mechanical age, New York, Museum of Modern Art, 1968, p.189, repr.\r\n(2) Cit\u00e9 in Andrew Forge, Rauschenberg, New York Harry N.

Quelle que soit l'appellation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Oracle -celle de sculpture \u00e9tant mal venue-, les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes d\u00e9nominations ont au moins en commun de rendre compte de l'agencement par Rauschenberg de mat\u00e9riaux divers, ici de rebut, rejet\u00e9s, n'ayant plus aucune valeur marchande ou morale. Le mat\u00e9riau d\u00e9valoris\u00e9 reprend alors vie mais avec d'autres fonctions, l'une des plus importantes \u00e9tant de laisser la possibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'artiste d'\"agir dans le vide qui existe entre l'art et la vie\". Raison pour laquelle Rauschenberg a tr\u00e8s souvent eu recours \u00e0 des objets qui ont conserv\u00e9 les traces du v\u00e9cu laiss\u00e9es par leur utilisateurs, et souvent devenus obsol\u00e8tes. L'art et la vie ne sont donc pas si \u00e9loign\u00e9s, d'autant que l'ajout d'un dispositif qui permet de capter les \u00e9missions de radio traversant les lieux o\u00f9 se trouve expos\u00e9e l'\u0153uvre continue ainsi \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuer un \u00e9ternel pr\u00e9sent, puisque toujours li\u00e9 \u00e0 la vie r\u00e9elle du spectateur auditeur \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. C'est peut-\u00eatre l\u00e0 une des explications du titres : l'oracle se prononce g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur l'avenir, le futur, mais pour cela, il lui faut conna\u00eetre le pr\u00e9sent et le pass\u00e9, \u00eatre simultan\u00e9ment au confluent des trois.

The present exhibition assembled by A. James Speyer, Curator of Contemporary Art, attempts to show some of the facets of the art of our times. That the artist reflects his environment is self-evident, and some of the works contained in the present exhibition reveal the tensions, frustrations and unrest which exist throughout the world today. Others reflect a kind of order and simplicity with which we attempt to regularize our lives, and some create, independently of time and environment. Indeed, the complexity of new art forms is manifest in the extraordinary variety of expression to be found today in contemporary art.\r\nAssisting Mr. Speyer in the exhibition have been Carole Herman and Anselmo Carini of the staff of the Art Institute of Chicago, who have seen the catalogue through the press and attended to many other details. Harold Buddenbohm, Superintendent, and his staff of maintenance personnel, have contributed much to the installation of the exhibition.\r\nWe are deeply grateful to our distinguished jury, James Elliott, Director of the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Martin L. Friedman, Director of the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and Porter A. McCray, Director of the JDR 3rd Fund for selecting the prize awards.\r\n- C.C. Cunningham, Director",

        "text": "My collaboration with Rauschenberg on what was to become Oracle (1962-65; cat. no. 246) began shortly after the Homage to New York performance, when I ran into him at the end of March 1960 at the Martha Jackson Gallery during an Antoni Tapies exhibition. He asked me if it was possible to make an interactive environment where the temperature, sound, smell, lights, etc., could be affected by the person who moved through it.\r\nOver the next year or two, my colleagues and I tried to work out Rauschenberg's idea for an interactive or, better, reactive environment, but it proved very difficult to achieve what he wanted. We would only work on it in our \"free\" time, which really meant that we took the time for it whenever we chose. Bell Laboratories, like any good research laboratory, left us alone to carry on our own experimental or theoretical research. During this time, I brought Rauschenberg to Bell Labs to see what my colleagues and I were working on.\r\nBy 1962, after many discussions with Rauschenberg, the idea of the work boiled down to a sound environment in which the sounds would come from five AM radios, and the audience could vary the volume and scan rate of each radio from a control unit. Originally, Rauschenberg had anticipated placing the five radios behind five large panels and housing the controls in a stand in front of them. We referred to the piece as an orchestra with the viewer as the conductor. Or as Rauschenberg remarked, \"The intent was to make a musical instrument that could be performed on, with or without sophistication.(7)\r\nRauschenberg did not want wires between the control unit and the radios. He insisted on using the AM band; in those days, FM was the outlet for cultural and classical-music programming. In addition, Rauschenberg wanted the visitor to be able to vary the speed of the scanning from station to station but not be able to stay at or tune in to any given station. Harold Hodges came up with a solution: the tuning dial was turned by a small, variable-speed, DC motor, and the visitor controlled the speed of the motor.\r\nAfter a lot of experimentation, Harold and I began work on a design in which the speakers on the AM radios would be removed, and the output from each radio would be re-transmitted by small AM transmitters to receivers, amplifiers, and speakers mounted behind each panel. At least two complete versions were built and rejected, because of interference between the control signals from the homemade AM transmitters and the AM radio signals, which generated a nightmare of noise.\r\nAll this had taken us a few more years, and what I remember most was working in my small apartment in Murray Hill and standing in endless lines in the electronics shops. By the time we felt that we could finish the system, by the end of 1964, Rauschenberg had long since turned the five panels into the painting Ace (1962; see fig. 90) and had begun to think of our project as a five-piece sculpture.\r\nIn the summer of 1964, the technology caught up with us. We found one of the first crystal-controlled, fully transistorized, wireless microphone systems. Then we were able to put all the AM radio controls for the volume and scanning speed in one of the sculpture pieces and retransmit the sound of the AM radios over the FM band, with a minimum of interference, to FM receivers, amplifiers, and speakers in each of the other sculpture pieces. From the control unit in one of the pieces, the visitors would be able to vary the sound level and the sweep rate of the five radios' station scanners, each associated with sounds in one of the sculpture pieces. For the FM transmitters and receivers, we used a Comdex wireless microphone system, and the radios were GE transistor radio receivers.(8)\r\nMany choices in projects like this one are not made purely on the basis of engineering considerations but are aesthetic choices. Rauschenberg chose the size and shape of the control knobs, the size of the speakers, and where to place the technical components in each piece. When I could no longer make \"midnight requisitions\" of the large gray-blue Bell Laboratories telephone batteries we had been using for the radios, I went to the store and bought the only substitute I could find: bright-red RCA batteries. I brought them to Rauschenberg's loft expecting that he would find the color terrible, but, of course, he immediately fell in love with it. And the red batteries were the only bright color in the piece, until they were discontinued by the manufacturer.(9)",

Rauschenberg wanted no wires from the control unit to the other pieces, so that they could ail be moved freely in relation to one another.\r\nWith the limited technology available in the early 1960's, we designed and built a system where ail the AM radios were located in the control unit and the sound was re-transmitted on the FM band to receivers and speakers in the other pieces. Interference between the FM transmitters and noise from the scanning motors were problems we had to solve. In this photograph Rauschenberg and I are working on Oracle.\r\n[...]\r\nWhen Harold Hodges and I were finishing the technical system, Rauschenberg put together the five sculptures that make up Oracle from objects he found in the streets. The pieces consist of a car door mounted on a typewriter table; a tub with an air conditioning duct through which water flows with, a small wire basket attached to the tub by a chain; a window frame attached to another long duct; an exhaust pipe on large wheels; and a large aluminum staircase which houses the control unit. I had ordered the aluminum staircase according to Bob's specs, and he added other objects to it. Bob located the speakers in each piece so that the piece had its own unique sound.",

        "text": "Oracle was shown at Leo Castelli Gallery on Seventy-seventh Street in Manhattan in May 1965. At the gallery, using an awl, Rauschenberg signed Oracle on the side of the staircase. He thought I should sign it as well, so I scratched in my name, adding, \"Sound Engineer.\" To minimize the pristine feeling of the gallery space, Rauschenberg covered the floor with a black rubber mat. The pieces were placed throughout the front room, and the viewer could freely walk among them and operate the controls on the staircase.\r\nIn full operation, Oracle becomes an animated cityscape. Using materials discarded from buildings and discovered on sidewalks, the sculptures are themselves as varied as the sights of a busy city street. The units can be placed anywhere in relation to one other, and the sound, too, can be \"re-arranged\" in ever-changing bits of music, talk, and noise\u2014 loud, soft, clear, or out of tune. The sound from the five radios comes to you as it would in a city neighborhood on a hot summer day. To this is added the only constant in the piece, the rushing sound of water from the fountain. Oracle has no fixed visual or aural shape. Any arrangement of the sculpture pieces in a room leaves open the possibility of another arrangement. It presents an open invitation to walk into it. When you do, the experience is as changing and provocative as the city it is reporting on.",

With the redesign, we moved the AM radios and the DC motors out of the control console and into each piece.

Digital control signals for volume and sweep rate were transmitted in the seventy megahertz band to servo motors in the other four pieces. ",

        "text": "DS: Would that have been the case just before your show that was called Oracle? I mean how did that very different adventure come about? Well, I suppose it wasn't so different from some of the objects you'd made before.\r\nRR: Oracle was I had started it I guess two and a half years ago, maybe even longer than that, closer to three. And it was going to be a radio painting but a concert variation. I did Broadcast, a painting that has three radios in it but only two tuning knobs, one for volume and one for tuning. And I objected to the fact that one had to be standing so close to the picture that the sound didn't seem to be using the space and the way the images were reacting to each other. And that was all right. That was one aspect of it. But through that, having made that and feeling that limitation with that piece, I wanted to do something that was remote control, that could be separated in the room. I had some canvases stretched, but it took so long I needed help with the radios. And it took so long for me to find the help that I used the paintings for something else. Then later I decided that was a good idea because once I started seeing what was involved I saw that with the weight problem, and the depth the painting would have to be to house the equipment, that painting was the wrong form for that to take. So I started on a sculpture. Then I went to Amsterdam to work at the Stadtlijk Museum with what was going to be a collaboration of about five artists, or six. And because I was working in sculpture, I had three weeks; we found that our ideas were so different that it was very difficult to get together and just make a piece.\r\n[...] So I was working with the sculpture which became Oracle with the radios. And painting didn't really interest me. So in a kind of crash program of three weeks I made four pieces of sculpture and some of them quite large. One of them is about ten or twelve feet high and was very densely massed, about eight feet by five feet, and twelve feet high. That was by far the largest work. But I'm not really a sculptor in any traditional sense. I tend to work with materials that are a little heavier and put them together as practically as I can. By being a sculptor, I mean I don't weld or solder.\r\n[...]\r\nDS: Has it continued to interest you since then? I mean, are you likely to resume?\r\nRR: I think the radio piece probably is the closest thing to what I'm about to do next as one can predict without knowing where one's going, because I like very much that mixture of technology and aesthetics.\r\nDS: I was interested in what you said last time we talked, I think, about the sound having been important in shifting the focus of the audience, in a sense, in that insuring a certain movement through the exhibition ...\r\nRR: Literally.\r\nDS: Literally, yes.\r\nRR: You had a sense of distance that as often as not was distorted. You had the feeling possibly of knowing where you were but where you were was lost.\r\nDS: That's very expressive. And another thing that you had mentioned which we haven't recorded was your feeling that it was important that the sound frequencies, that the radio sources, be actual ones, not taped; and your feeling that if you had been able to tape them, it would have been rather like commercial art in that not being an actual ...\r\nRR: Yes.\r\nDS: Would you like to enlarge on that in any way?\r\nRR: No, I think that just about says it. I like for the sound to be as fresh as the daily fall of the dust and rust and dirt that accumulates, which doesn't mean that one doesn't clean it off from time to time. But then that's another thing. It's an actuality of a literal insistence on the piece's operating and existing in the time situation that it's observed in. It's another one of those things trying to put off the death of the work.\r\nDS: Yes. Did I hear you mention before that you had in mind possibly using at some time in the future a piece in which the wind might work as an actual force?\r\nRR: Yes. I'd like to work with wind and water and plants. It sounds like it's going to be a garden, but I don't think it's going to be, but if it turns out to be a garden that may be my own sneaky way of moving out into the country. I hope I don't pick this new building out just in order to discover that what I really needed was a farm. In fact, having two dogs now is also an indication that I'm trying to get out.",

        "text": "We had worked on the technical equipment for Oracle for about three years before it was finished.\u00a0We didn\u2019t work continuously, of course, and constantly there were [always ] unsolved problems.\u00a0My assistant at the laboratory, Harold Hodges, did most of the construction work.\u00a0It seems to me as if I spent most of the time in endless queues in the electronic shops.\u00a0Two complete systems were built and discarded as technically unsatisfactory.\u00a0The third and last system was built during the end of 1964 and the beginning of 1965. It was installed in the last weeks before the opening on the 15th of May, 1965.\u00a0My daughter was born the same day, and it was not until a week later that could I find out that the system worked better than I had expected.\u00a0The costs for the electronic components had then surpassed thirty thousand crowns, while the labor costs were about fifteen thousand. \r\nAt this time it goes without saying that Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s sculpture Oracle is magnificent. It is a work of art which sums up much in his work to date and also points forward and gives a clue of what will come. When you work so closely with an artist for such a long time and have the opportunity to get discouraged many times and then become greatly surprised over the results, you appreciate [feel] more than ever the specific and the glorious way in which the artist sees. \r\n[...]\r\nThe difficulties that arose during the work with Oracle were maybe not so much of a technical nature (the minute we had decided on the solution the technical problems were normal), as in the collaboration with Rauschenberg.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean that Rauschenberg in any way is difficult to work with; he is in reality of wonder of patience.\u00a0 It is simply difficult for an engineer to have a conversation with an artist.\u00a0The engineer speaks slowly and with a natural hesitation.\u00a0He knows that the problem can be solved even if he can\u2019t solve it at that moment.\u00a0He is worried about costs and needs time to experiment and to find out which materials are available.\u00a0He tries to press the artist for a more detailed description.\u00a0What is the goal ?\u00a0 How strong should the amplifiers be ?\u00a0What noise level is permissible ?\u00a0Can interference between the local oscillators in the radio receivers be permitted?\u00a0What was the maximum and minimum sweep speed ? Should it be possible for a visitor to stop at a certain station ?\u00a0How many hours should the batteries last ?\u00a0The artist works, on his side, fast and with his hands.\u00a0He works with facts and does not bind himself to theoretical details which concern the future.\u00a0In a month, in a year, maybe his attitude will be completely different from today.\u00a0He does not know the engineer\u2019s language, he does not know the meaning of the words. Can the engineer be trusted ? And the engineer needs complete information in order to solve the problem.\u00a0The artist wants as much freedom as is possible over the result. It is not a question of a collaboration, but rather a contractual relationship between the artist and the engineer so that in the end the engineer is only part of the total work of the artist.\u00a0The artist has to accept the engineer as he is.\u00a0 \r\nDuring our work with Oracle, several of these questions came up.\u00a0We never arrived at any rational way of working, but I understood that we had to work, apart from the costs, with such a margin that Rauschenberg had as much freedom as possible as we worked towards the final solution.\u00a0 In this way the high sound level was not present in the original specifications for the system.\u00a0We did give Rauschenberg the means to change the sound level, which he wanted to keep high, something we had not foreseen but that he used.\u00a0On the other hand, every amplifier was attached to a speaker of good quality.\u00a0These Rauschenberg replaced with smaller speakers of worse quality.\r\nOracle needed a high sound level but a relatively bad sound quality (in order to give the impression that you listened to somebody else\u2019s radio.)\u00a0 Other amusing questions appeared repeatedly:\u00a0 What was a technical decision, and what was an \u201caesthetic\u201d decision.\u00a0 The color of the batteries, the size of the controls, the placement of the technical components were all aesthetic decisions.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy for an engineer to get trapped in what he\u2019s doing and make decisions on the basis of what is \u201cbeautiful\u201d instead of what is technically necessary.\u00a0The engineer cannot see what he does as art.\u00a0 In regards to aesthetic questions, working with Rauschenberg became very intimate.\u00a0 \r\nWe\u2019ve learned that the painting is an object among other objects in a room.\u00a0 Jasper Johns shows the back side of a painting.\u00a0 During a piece by John Cage we are forced to accept all sounds as an equal part of the composition.\u00a0Claus Oldenburg let the people whom he uses in his happenings play themselves (in most cases the actors are not conscious of this fact.)\u00a0Oldenburg writes roles in his happenings for a certain person.\u00a0 In such a way the individuals\u2019 shyness, nervousness, and sexuality become part of the happening.\u00a0 \r\nTradition can therefore not tell us anything else but that the technical material in Oracle is an integral part of the sculpture just like the car door, the basin or the window frame.\u00a0 It is impossible to treat the sound as part of the work of art and not the radios themselves. But what is the engineer\u2019s relationship to the artist?\u00a0 He uses his creativity and his experience to create something at the direction of the artist, which he obviously could not make by himself.\u00a0 In the same way that Oldenburg works with and accepts the peculiarities of his actors, the artist has to accept the engineer.\u00a0 The artist is a means for the engineer to arrive at a result, and the artist is equally bound to him as Michelangelo was to his marble.\u00a0Oracle points to the fact that a new type of relationship is possible between the artist and the engineer, and perhaps even between the artist and the scientist.\u00a0 A relationship where the artist tries to use the enormous richness of technology and science to achieve his goal.\u00a0 The goal of the artist may be equally as technically complicated as building a huge accelerator or launching of\u00a0 a satellite, but his goals should lie within as yet undiscovered areas of art and science:\u00a0 to create new wonders, new sensual experiences, new pressures, new ways to experience each other, new ways to experience light, dark, coldness, heat; new ways to sleep, to be, and to eat.\u00a0 Every engineer is conscious today of the fact that no exaggerations can describe the capacity of technology, but at the same time, the inventiveness of the engineers, how technology can be used, limited by his laziness, one-sidedness, and psychological attitude.\u00a0 The relation of the engineer to the use of technology in art can today be compared to the people who insist that the only goal of art is to create a beautiful object full of a higher order.\u00a0 The engineer cannot believe that the technology can be used to create disorder, but the artist can.\u00a0 The artist, and only the artist, can show the engineer how technology can be used at its full capacity.\u00a0 The technical part of Oracle is senseless from any engineering point of view possible.\u00a0 From the radios all tuned to the AM four radio programs are re-transmitted to four other transceivers--in the same room.\u00a0 The engineer can only shake his head when he hears that such a project cost almost 50,000 crowns.",

        "text": "The Sculpture was to be shown at the grand opening of the Centre Pompidou in 1977, and Hodges and I got involved again. Twelve years of wear and tear on the system and further advances in technology made it clear that the piece should be redesigned for its new location. We also saw a chance to get rid of the last remaining problems of noise and interference. With the redesign, we were now able to move the AM radios and the DC motors out of the control console and into each piece, eliminating the need to retransmit the control signals from the console. We installed what was called a \"digital proportional remote radio control system\" designed for remote-controlled hobby airplanes. Digital control signals for volume and sweep rate were transmitted in the 70 MHz band to servomotors in the other four pieces. Oracle had now entered the space age.\r\nI went to Paris to install Oracle and found that Beaubourg was not a friendly place for it. The steel structure of the building acted as a Faraday cage, shielding the interior from the relatively long electromagnetic waves of the AM frequency band, so that only static could be heard on Oracle's radios. To overcome this problem, I had to install a master receiving antenna on the roof. (The only access to the roof was a thirty foot ladder from the sixth floor outside walk-way and I found myself all alone on the roof stringing the wire for the large antenna.) To get the AM signal to the gallery where Oracle was shown, I used a Jerrold Broadcast Band Amplifier, which was designed for radio showrooms and promised \"you can turn on your AM radios and demonstrate the static-free humfree reception that generate sales.\" Hardly space-age technology, but the best I could do. What made the situation worse was that there were only 3 AM radio stations in Paris and a few audible stations from the rest of France. I had hoped to be able to tune the system to receive other European stations, but lack of time and help made this impossible in time for the opening.\r\nRauschenberg arrived and we worked frenetically to get Oracle going. An hour before the official opening, we plugged in the pump motor for the shower and blew all the fuses in our section of the museum. The electricians had gone home for the day and no one knew where to find the fuse box. When Minister of Culture Michel Guy and the director Pontus Hulten brought President Giscard d'Estaing and Princess Grace by, we were standing in semi-darkness. The sound from a few lonely radio stations could be heard from Oracle, and with the refrigeration coils inoperative, the frozen fat was slowly melting in Joseph Beuys' piece nearby.",

        "text": "I was able to plan a re-design of the system for Oracle in 1979. Engineer Ted Dillenkofer built a re-designed system for Oracle, which he and I installed in February 1979, after installing Solstice in the museum in Japan. All the electronics had been shipped to New Jersey and Ted worked with his father in his father's radio workshop to design and build the new system. Ted remembered:\r\nAn five AM band radios were put in the staircase unit and the visitor could directly control their volumes and sweep rates from the sets of knobs on the top of the staircase. The audio outputs from each of those AM radios went into a small wireless FM microphone which transmitted the signals to small FM receivers that were out in each of the individual pieces of the sculpture, which in turn were connected to the speakers. So the only thing that was actually being transmitted was the audio output of the AM radios.\r\nThe microphones were basically connected to the audio outputs of the radios. I don't remember whether they are connected to the speaker outputs or whether we bypassed the amplification section and just took it from the initial stages of the amplification system in those AM radios. There is a small coil in the transmitting microphones and you can adjust the frequency of each one individually. These were pretty primitive devices. You couldn't punch in what frequency they are supposed to transmit. But you can sit there and fiddle with them and fiddle with the radio; and it's a process where you set one and you set the radio for it, then you set the next one and you set the radio for if and you try not to get any interference between them; and then set the third one and try to set its radio, and it's an iterative thing.\r\nThe problem I had to deal with in setting the frequencies was interference in the FM transmitting frequency and with harmonies. There are not very tight filters on the signals. If you ever look at the frequency spectrum of the transmitted signal there is a big peak around where the center frequency is supposed to be and there are smaller peaks out to the side. Since with Oracle everything is being transmitted within ten feet, those smaller peaks are still pretty sizable peaks and they get locked on and get picked up by those FM receivers, so you wind up hearing things that you shouldn't hear on the various receivers, which sound like two radios rather than one radio.\r\nI tried to make the main peaks as far apart as possible and not mathematically related. If you have a peak that is at a harmonic frequency of one of the other frequencies that is set, well naturally it is already locked in there and picks up that harmonic tao. You spread the frequencies across the band as far as you can and then you fiddle with them a little at a time to make sure they are just off from each other.\"",

        "text": "G.R. Swenson's account of Rauschenberg's studio (1) deals with a crucial period in 1962 when he was contemplating several new directions. These included both the silk-screen paintings and the \"Concert Project\", which appeared at last in 1965 as Oracle (2). This was a development of an earlier experiment with sound, the painting Broadcast of 1959, in which he had used three radios.\r\n\"In Broadcast\", he told, Swenson, \"I was interested, academically, in the relation sound would have to looking... I assumed that because the picture would have a voice, it would have to be bright and loud.\" At first he had used large letters and strongly contrasted colors, but when he finally inserted and used the radios he found that the whole painting flattened \"like a poster\" and that \"loud\" lost its double meaning. Something visually loud and emphatic, \"which you could see from across the room\", had the opposite effect with regard to sound and noise. \"The painting went dead. All the boldness looked superficial, it implied merely static strength. I realized that the details should not be taken in at a glance, that you should be able to look from place to place without feeling the bigger image. I had to make a surface which invited a constant change of focus and an examination of detail. Listening happens in time. Looking also happens in time\".\r\nThe three radios in Broadcast were set into the back of the painting, their tuning knobs projecting from its surface. The onlooker was free to tune them as he wished, but Rauschenberg was dissatisfied with the limitation that this placed on his movement in front of the picture. If the relation of sound and looking was to be developped it had to be realized in the appropriate space. The first form of the \"Concert Project\" was as five painting with speakers that could be remotely controlled. This idea was set aside (the five panels later becoming the painting Ace), and Rauschenberg became increasingly absorbed in the prospect of giving the five speakers to five free standing objects.\r\nIn its final form Oracle consists of a console with steps that one can mount and four other objects, of which the main features are a length of industrial duct in the form of a funnel, a window frame with duct, a car door, and a cistern.\r\nIn action each piece can be placed anywhere within the receiving range of the tuning system housed in the console. Each piece, the console included, has its own battery-operated radio, the tuning of which is in turn radio-operated. From the console on can control the volume and the tuning of each one, and also one can set the tuning motion so that a particular radio moves through the wave bands at a given speed. Thus, any one piece, which has its own distinctive timbre -the funnel deep and sonorous, the window dry and vibrant like snare drums, the car door raucous- can be set loud or soft, to music or speech, to any program that happens to be, or just static, off or on tune, fast or slow, swelling and ebbing from this station to the next, or stationary, or going through the band so fast that it twitters like a pack of cards sprung against the thumb. The one fixed point is the citern, which, in addition to its radio, pumps water through a shower spray into a tank. Its solid downward gush, turned in on itself, not broadcast, is a soothing alternative to the restless electronic sound.\r\nTo stand by the console is to be aware of a continual coming and going of sound, predominantly spatial. Yet it is not a space demarcated by its points of origin. It is a space that one hears, not a visible one. What one hears is a total sound, even though its parts can be identified as five voices; its movement seems to disintegrate the actual space marked out by the machines and to reconstitute it as something plastic, expanding and contracting, warping and cockling, a billowing whole whose boundaries token an utterly different order from the visible boundaries of the junk pieces. The very sensation of hearing, it seems, has become a kind of looking. One doesn't know which way to point one's eyes, so strikingly does the sound reframe the appearance of the machines, giving them a kind of speed -despite the fact that they just stand there dinning- or if not speed, a kind of flashing nowhereness like parked cars seen peripherally from a speeding scooter. And as soon as you move away from the console, among the pieces, you find your movements, your familiar physical measuring of close distances becoming a matter of urgency to be set alongside this new space that you are hearing inside your head. Pacing, steering, or the avoidance of edges is set beside the expanding elastic space in your head.",

Five pieces, in the round, with sound, called Oracle. Five wheeled vehicules, responsibly plumb and electronically neat, or canted, askew, subtly aged with the Rauschenberg patina or metropolitan fallout and gutter gangrene. From each a shiny chrome tail protudes, an FM antenna, no less, because the sound part is serious and complex. (Well, not serious, but complicated).\r\n\r\nThat special sense of humor is operating again. How can one convey the irony, the wry understatement, the hilarious sense of absurd juxtaposition of things, the rock solid motion of bizarre appropriateness? Who ever heard of such objects (a car door, a typewriter table, the most outrageously textured piece of metal since the invention of abstract expressionism) cohabiting?\r\n\r\nLast summer in Venice, the europeans (for them, pop means using objects), seeing his most recent pictures, the pure silk screen paintings of 1963-1964, said that Rauschenberg had transcended pop, even though he invented it. He certainly seemed to have put aside his involvement in the combine-painting through this long episode of flat painting. But now that is over; His restless inventiveness requires him to keep moving, and we should not be surprised to see him become interested in objects again.\r\n\r\nActually, this project has a long history, even if Rauschenberg may have finished the work at this time because of a renewed engagement with the problems. The idea originates in his first sound painting with radios, Broadcast, of 1959. In that piece, Knobs projecting from the surface permitted one to tune an ensemble of radios, producing a collage of sound. Rauschenberg felt that Broadcast could not function for the viewer/listener as well as he would have liked because one had to stand so close to tune it. He envisioned another project which could be remotely controlled, so that you could see and hear the result from a distance. He settled on a scheme of five independent paintings (\"Five is the first complicated number; it's not two pairs, three or a couple\"). The five panels were stretched, but the electronic problems became so complex that they held up the project. Typically, the canvases somehow promptly disappeared into Ace, one of his best and largest (20 feet) paintings of the period.\r\n\r\nThe radio parts imposed a certain depth on the paintings in this scheme (Broadcast is seven or eight inches deep), and it occured to Rauschenberg that sculpture would offer more interesting possibilities than the flat surfaces. As a result, he began to work on the five parts of Oracle in the spring of that year, 1962, but the project was interrupted by a trip to Amsterdam that summer. Until this winter, the work has progressed very slowly, constantly delayed by painting and by Rauschenberg's dance activities. The pieces had been close to their present state for some time, but once more electronic complexities held up the job.\r\n\r\nBilly Kl\u00fcver, the Edison-Tesla-Steinmetz-Marconi-Leonardo Da Vinci of the American Avant Garde (almost all the gadgetry which has figured so prominently in object art during the past five years was engineered and executed by Kl\u00fcver, a Bell Laboratories research scientist), designed and built the radio system, which seems simple but is really quite elaborate. From the console unit five radios can be controlled, four in the other pieces via transmitters from the console; on five different FM frequencies, signals from the panel govern the volume and the speed of continuous tuning of the five radios. The result is a complex spectrum of sound which can be constantly altered by one person at the controls. Technical difficulties which had to be resolved included problems like that of interference among the transmitters; furthermore, the apparatus had to be foolproof and stable in performance.\r\n\r\nMost difficult of all, of course, was the condition that the pieces had to be wholly mobile; otherwise they might simply have been connected by cables. Each of the units is self-contained and battery operated. Time has helped to solve some of the problems. The transmitters used were simply not available when the project was started three years ago; The present electronic system is the third since the work began.\r\n\r\nApart from the accidental melange of sound produced by the random tuning of the radios, the quality of sound varies from piece to piece according to the acoustical properties of each, so that they boom, rattle or trumpet through their insane gimcrackery of compulsive metalwork ducting and miscegenated vehicles. The electronic impurity of the sound suffers adulteration from only one source, the absolutely idiotic waterworks which may well be the only mobile fountain in existence.\r\n\r\nRauschenberg conceived the ensemble as being freely adaptable to any space and circumstance. The units may be placed anywhere within the range of the transmitters; Their mobility encourages rearrangement. The pieces seem daftly on the go. One wishes the controls also operated motors. What an antic traffic jam that would make!\r\n\r\nAlan Solomon.",

Its antecedent was one of Rauschenberg's combine-paintings of 1959, Broadcast, in which he used radios. Wishing to achieve a situation in which the relationship between object and spectator was less restricted, he conceived the idea of developing the project in three-dimensional objects. Three years of interrupted experiments with the radio system in collaboration with Kl\u00fcver followed? New technical possibilities that presented themselves during the evolution of the work were incorporated into it. The progression from Rauschenberg's original \"combine\" idea into an increasingly advanced technology seems to indicate the direction that collaboration between artists and engineers is likely to take in the future.\r\nThe underlying theme of Oracle is openess and contact with the city. The components of the five sculptural pieces all come from New York, as does also the sound emitted by the five different radios. The five parts are self-contained and may be rearranged at will. This work is like a concentrate of the city situation, characterized by the accidental mixture of sound, mobility, freedom, and at the same time mutual interdependence.",

        "text": "When I first met him, in January, 1962, Robert Rauschenberg had just returned from an electronics laboratory in New Jersey. In his studio stood five large, tall white canvas panels, leaning against the longest wall of his newly painted white loft. He had been making arrangements at the laboratory for a system of radio loud speakers, one to go behind each panel, which would operate by remote control from a central cabinet. But the five panels which he had intended to use in the radio project were instead used for the quiet and majestic Ace, finished a few weeks later.\r\n\tThere had been several large metal objects in the corner of his studio the day he returned from the electronics laboratory. They began to occupy more and more of his interest, and over a period of time they were moved to his central working area [fig. 6]. There were five pieces and he planned to put a radio into each of them; he also played with the idea of using running water, and eventually one of the pieces of the \"concert project\" became a fountain.\r\n\tOne of the pieces for that project was a car door. The stages of response which changes in and around the door gradually evoked led to a better understanding of one aspect of Rauschenberg's work\u2014the way he \"transforms\" objects. He does not use them as pure form and color, destroying our sense of their origin\u2014which is what is usually meant by \"transformation.\" Rather he seeks to retain or reinstate some quality the object possessed in its original environment. The door of a car is not noticeably distinguished from the frame of the car; it is seldom noticed, even when we use it. If we were to encounter such an object alone on the street, however, we would probably begin to notice the form of the door itself. When we see such an object in an artist's studio, we see a mere form with overtones of an automobile. Such a transformation had already taken place when I first saw the car door. What surprised me most was the way it gradually lost its quality of being a \"transformed\" object. It was re-integrated into a situation\u2014given an environment in which it was both in place, as originally, and yet not smothered as pure form. Between the first time I saw it and the last, it had acquired literacy and an ability to communicate. I once mentioned that his objects often assert themselves so strongly that only time can integrate them for me. He said, \"I don't like to take advantage of an object that can't defend itself.\r\n\t\"When an object you're using does not stand out but yields its presence to what you're doing, it collaborates, so to speak\u2014it implies a kind of harmony.\" The object blends indistinguishable into the pure colors and forms of the painting. \"It ceases to be a simple tonality, but is part of a harmony in which no note can really be heard because the over-all vibrations are so unified. I like the idea of one sound, but I really don't like the idea that it is none of its components.\" He would not achieve a large harmonic structure at the expense of its components. \"I would like my pictures to be able to be taken apart as easily as they're put together\u2014so you can recognize an object when you're looking at it. Oil paint really does look like oil paint even in the most photographic painting.\"\r\n\tSeveral months after he finished Ace and started to work on the \"concert\" project, he began the piece whose progress was to be photographed and reported. Rauschenberg intended to do a small and simple combine-painting; the initial focus for the painting was a small wooden door. During the following months he worked intermittently on both this piece and the concert-radio project. His alternations reflected in part difficulties arising from being observed as well as from felt responsibilities not connected with his work itself. \"I became too interested in the radio piece. The only honest thing to do was let that be the object of attention. Then I became embarrassed because it was taking shape so slowly and I was holding up the article. I decided to abandon the sculpture and concentrate only on the combine. I did, but, paid for it by not working well.\"",

For the first, my colleagues and I set up a system of directional photocells aimed at the stage lights, so that the dancers triggered sounds as they cut the light beams with their movements. A second system used a series of antennas. When a dancer came within four feet of an antenna a sound would result. Ten photocells were wired to activate tape-recorders and short-wave radios. Cecil Coker designed a control circuit, which was built by my assistant Witt Wittnebert. Film footage by Stan VanDerBeek and Nam June Paik's manipulated television images were projected on screens behind the dancers. ",

While working on the idea, my colleague at Bell Laboratories found a material called ScotchpakTM which was relatively impermeable to helium and could be heat sealed. It was used by the United States Army for wrapping sandwiches. When I brought this material to Andy he decided to make clouds and while we were figuring out how to heat-seal curves, he simply folded the material over and made these Silver Clouds, which were first shown at Leo Castelli's gallery in 1966. The sculptures had a wonderful buoyancy as they hovered gently in the room. The heat gradient between the floor and ceiling creates a slight pressure differential; we could balance the Silver Clouds using paperclips to make them float between ceiling and floor.",

The art community in New York became involved in helping us with 9 Evenings, as fellow artists, dancers, musicians, and performers volunteered their time for setting up and trouble shooting, and then appeared in the performances. A high-powered, but slightly distorted publicity campaign resulted in more than 1500 people each night attended the performances, many of them unprepared for the avant-garde performances they saw. In this photograph the crowd is entering the Armory on opening night. The 9 EVENINGS poster, designed by Rauschenberg, hangs on either side of the entrance, and an Army transport truck sits on the street, displaced from its usual parking place on the Armory floor.",

There are a lot of decisions, like amplifiers and the choice of speakers. I have bought about eight or nine different speakers which have all kinds of criteria. Alex Hay: We need baffles for speakers. Kluver: You've got to start from the beginning; what the speakers are, then the baffles. The general situation is that we have people working on all the aspects of this wireless. (Billy gives a lot of technical description of the wireless system. The artists look blank.) It is just too difficult for me to act as an in-between and handle twenty engineers and ten artists. I can't call people for every single screw. I tell artists fo call scientists and scientists to call artists and no one calls. If there isn't direct human contact between you and the person working with you, if I have to do it, then it isn't contact. There are so many decisions going on now that you should be making along with the engineers. like, should the boxes be square or flat. Hay: As functional as possible. Kluver: That's not how things are made. You take what's on the shelf and if something special is needed, you ...\r\n[...]\r\nAlex Hay, 9/17: I want to pick up faint body sounds like brain waves, cardiac sounds, muscle sounds, and to amplify activity, its changing tempo and value. But we'd underestimated the problems about the transmitters. And Schneider was only assigned to me three weeks ago, and the first tests were just made last Wednesday. Billy thought the amplifiers they had could be modified but they can't. Now Cumminsky and Coker are working on it.",

Pete Kaminsky, Fred Waldhauer and Cecil Coker built a battery-driven differential amplifier which had a peak gain of 80 db at low frequencies from 1/2 Hz to 10Hz. The whole unit, batteries and all fit into a 1\"x3\"x5\" box, no mean feat to do this in 1966. The signal from the differential amplifier was fed into a voltage-controlled oscillator, then to a transmitter, which sent the sound to the speakers. Electrodes were placed on Hay's head and body and ail the equipment was attached to a plastic plate fastened on Hay's back. These body sounds were heard through the speakers as Hay carefully laid out 64 numbered pieces of cloth. Here Hay is sitting in front of a television camera and the image of his face is projected on the screen behind him as Robert Rauschenberg picks up numbered cloths.",

Some projects will be scrapped and others will be added as we go along. A: artist who is mainly interested. T : technicians who will be mainly concerned.\r\n1. 500 kc doppler sonar to pick up ordinary motion by the body. Beat frequency should be directly audible. A: Childs T: Coker, Klu\u0308ver\r\n2.\"Cocktailpartyeffect\" Many (50 ? , 100 ?) speakers of low power placed on walls or around the room, or outside.Each speaker giving a different sound. What is the minimum amount of tape recorders that need be used? How many channels can be put on one tape? A: Paxton T : Mc Gee end others.\r\n3. Stretch rubber or fabric in two directions so that area is multiplied many times. Probably use textured yarn and have commercial knitter make fabric to specification. A: D. Hay T: Wagner and others.\r\n4. Use of air wall. Find out what is commercially available. Is it possible to make the wall opaque by adding powder to the airstream? How large do the air walls come? A; D. Bay and Mothers T: ?\r\n5. Jello in which parts of the body can be immersed. A:Fahlstr\u00f6m T: Winslow and others.\r\n6. Clouds. Solid and otherwise.

        "text": "For Grass Field Alex Hay wanted to pick up body sounds: brain waves, muscle activity and eye movements. Pete Kaminsky, Fred Waldhauer and Cecil Coker built a battery-driven differential amplifier which had a peak gain of 80 db at low frequencies from 1/2 Hz to 10Hz. The whole unit, batteries and all fit into a 1\"x3\"x5\" box, no mean feat to do this in 1966. The signal from the differential amplifier was fed into a voltage-controlled oscillator, then to a transmitter, which sent the sound to the speakers. Electrodes were placed on Hay's head and body and ail the equipment was attached to a plastic plate fastened on Hay's back. These body sounds were heard through the speakers as Hay carefully laid out 64 numbered pieces of cloth. Here Hay is sitting in front of a television camera and the image of his face is projected on the screen behind him as Robert Rauschenberg picks up numbered cloths.",

(Several of the artists wanted to float in the air.) These meetings lasted through March, and we gathered seventy artists' requests. Then one engineer was assigned to each artist depending on the artist's project and the engineer's field of expertise. Other engineers worked on sound and control equipment and systems that would be used by all the performers.",

        "text": "Robert Rauschenberg: When you're working with something that's as physical as radio equipment, what's absurd to do is very quickly determined. The machine has no tolerance for getting outside a particular radio wave or whatever it is you're working with. The kind of equipment we're inviting has its own integrity built into it. Whereas an artist has to somehow assume integrity or not. I think just that experience of dealing with these kinds of material that have this particular character is probably going lo end up being an enormous influence on the work esthetically.\r\n[...]\r\nLarry Heilos (tech) 4/5: The artists shouldn't feel restricted in their demands. We can tell them if what they want can be done now. Cage wants to get video through audio. People in industry would throw up their hands and say you can't do it. We have to try it out. We may lose a few dollars worth of tape. The requests are not surprising. Many are on electronics. Many are challenging, such as Fahlstrom's missile. I'm running down TV information. And I've been on the tail of a guy at Beva Electronics who says he can build infrared TV. The only thing to do is to tell the guys in industry from the very beginning what you have in mind. The cooperation has been great. I've talked with NBC on occasion and they're very cooperative.\r\n[...]\r\nAuthor's journal, 6/17: There's a lot of anxiety, and a lot of joking among the artists with whom I have the most contact. I get the image of Rauschenberg trying to back up into an idea. I took part in a conversation which amounted to: Art and Oceanography. And a discussion of that. Art and Criminology. And a discussion of that. Art and Travel. And so on through a long list and several drinks and laughter. Bob Whitman has referred to Billy Kluver as Fu Man Chu, the evil genius, mad scientist.\r\n[...]\r\nRauschenberg: Isn't there a kind of intimidation going on, like: technology, even if it isn't functioning, is perfect? Let's talk about the show. When we meet with the technicians, we talk about equipment. At our meetings we talk about equipment. What is everybody going to do? Let's talk visually.\r\n[...]\r\nDick Wolff (tech) 11/17: Someone asked if we could turn lights on and off by remote control with no connections [this required a radio transmitter to send signals to a receiver connected to the lights). From that we realized what we had and started describing it to other artists and they started asking more questions and having other ideas. Debbie's request for remote control of eight platforms gave us the necessity for channels [because this required eight transmitters, each sending stop & go signals to a separate receiver]. So we went ahead and used the channels for other things too. Tudor and Cage used the channels extensively. Cage used them to turn speakers on and off as he walked in front of the lights. Tudor to turn on and off lights. We didn't use all the equipment to its fullest but that's for the future. After we had built that equipment, Rauschenberg's idea of the rackets came along [a transmitter attached to a tennis racket to transmit the sound of the ball hitting the racket]. And that was a good idea. We tried it out here at the labs and in fifteen minutes we knew it worked. Billy came down the hall with tennis rackets and asked me if I had a transmitter and receiver and we hooked it up and stood in the hall hitting the ball back and forth and it sounded just like it did in the show. It just required some smoothing over, hiding the transmitter and making the sound better.\r\nThe fact that so much work went into communications was largely because of the influence of the engineers. You can accomplish a lot with two tin cans and a string but we're not happy with that. It's not sophisticated enough. The decoder that Robbie (Robinson) made did something that was never planned or asked for and the artists went and used it. That was the time-stepping that Cage and Tudor used [a delay mechanism by which, for instance, a light might go on a minute after receiving its \"on\" signal].\r\n[...]\r\nAuthor's journal, 9/25: The second half of Rauschenberg's piece will use, for sound, tapes that will have been made during the first half. That is, they will be recordings of the sounds made by the balls hitting the prepared rackets. Herb Schneider thought that the tape loops could be triggered electronically in a predetermined, programmed relationship. This would avoid having McGee have to run around and watch the machines and keep rewinding the tapes. Bob says, \"I don't want to figure out at what moment all the machines will be working. Making that kind of decision is the traditional art way. Of course, even programming might necessitate some practical considerations such as, for example, tape three and four can't go at the same time because they're on the same machine.\" But what Bob wishes is to have McGee \"work like crazy to get everything going and keep it going.\"\r\n[...]\r\n",

At each BONG, one of the 48 lights went out, and the game ended when the Armory was in complete darkness. Five hundred people came on stage in the dark. Using infrared light and infrared television cameras, their images were picked up and projected on three large screens suspended in front of the audience.

        "text": "By the time Oracle was finished in 1965, I had taken dozens of artists through Bell Laboratories, and many of my colleagues and I had worked on individual projects with artists. But I felt that our efforts remained pitifully small given the explosive growth of new technical possibilities and resources that had become available in the 1960s. Most artists were shut out of this important area of society.\r\nI came to believe that a hands-on working relationship between artist and engineer was the best means for providing the artist with access to technology. Rauschenberg's strong commitment to the idea of collaboration shaped my thinking. We evolved the idea of the one-to-one collaboration between individuals, each operating as a professional in his or her own field in contributing to a joint project.\r\nThis idea of the artist-engineer collaboration was the central force behind 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering, a series of performances we organized and then presented on October 13-16, 18, 19, and 21-23, 1966 at the Sixty-ninth Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue at Twenty-fifth Street in New York.\r\nThe project actually began in fall 1965, when Knut Wiggen, who was then the head of Fylkingen, a contemporary-music society in Stockholm, asked me to organize the participation of American artists in what he called a Festival of Art and Technology in Stockholm, I discussed the idea with Rauschenberg, and we invited composers John Cage and David Tudor, choreographers Lucinda Childs, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton, and Yvonne Rainer, and artists \u00d6yvind Fahlstr\u00f6m and Robert Whitman to join us on the project. I recruited fellow engineers from Bell Laboratories to work with the artists.\r\nAt the first meeting between the artists and the engineers, on January 14, 1966, I told the artists that they could ask for anything they wanted, and I asked the engineers to respond with suggestions on how to accomplish these ideas, if they could be realized at all. (Several of the artists wanted to float in the air.) These meetings lasted through March, and we gathered seventy artists' requests. Then one engineer was assigned to each artist depending on the artist's project and the engineer's field of expertise. Other engineers worked on sound and control equipment and systems that would be used by all the performers.\r\nAccording to lists I made following these meetings, Rauschenberg requested:\r\nInfrared TV. Find out what TV pickup tubes are available on the market. What frequencies do body and other objects omit? What infrared light sources are available? How strong? The room in which the action occurs should be \"dark\" to visible light. Forms of rebroadcast: snooperscopes, TV sets, Eidophor [at the first meeting].\r\nLight sensitive chemical which changes color (or From colorless to color) in presence of light. Not ultraviolet. This should happen in controlled area. Temperature and pressure-sensitive colors. Color change with pressure. Live fabrics [at the fifth meeting].\r\nUsing TV tape for mixing of sound and image in super-imposition economically (black and white). Printing of tape manually\u2014without tape recorders. Strong continuous or intermittent light to light up a room [at the fifth and sixth meetings] [12]\r\nInfrared television became central to Rauschenberg's piece. His system required television pickup tubes operating in the infrared end of the spectrum, that is, sensitive to the temperature of objects. Such a system would be able to capture images of people in total darkness. I asked Larry Heilos, a research assistant at Bell Labs, to find an infrared television system for Rauschenberg.",

        "text": "Rauschenberg's Open Score began with a tennis game between Frank Stella and Mimi Kanarek on a full-scale tennis court laid out on the Armory Boor. As Rauschenberg wrote, \"Tennis is movement. Put in the context of theater it is a formal dance improvisation,\" But he also used the game \"to control the lights and to perform as an orchestra.\"' [15]\r\nBill Kaminski of Bell Laboratories had designed a tiny crystal-controlled FM transmitter, which could fit into the handle of a tennis racket. A contact microphone was placed at the top of the handle, and the antenna for the transmitter was wound around the racket head, We had requested and, to my surprise, received authorization from the FCC to use ten frequencies on the FM band in between the local FM stations. Of course, the transmitters had to be limited to a few milliwatts of output power.\r\nWhen the ball hit the racket, the vibrations of the strings were picked up by the contact microphone and transmitted to an FM radio receiver, amplified, and fed to twelve speakers, resulting in an enormous BONG that vibrated around the Armory. Each lime Frank or Mimi hit the ball, the accompanying BONG switched off one of forty-eight 1-kilowatt lights illuminating the court. The game ended when the Armory was in complete darkness, leaving the score still open.\r\nThe crowd of people then entered in the darkness. To increase image quality, infrared light illuminated the crowd as the infrared-sensitive television cameras picked up its movements. The television images were projected onto three large screens suspended in front of the audience (see fig. 70). The audience could sense the presence of the crowd but could only \"see\" the performers through the projected tele- vision image.\r\nRauschenberg used flashlights generating predetermined cues to choreograph the movements of the crowd. David White remembers that groups of flashlights were attached to the railing of the balcony that ran around the Armory, with one group on each of the Armory's four sides, so that members of the crowd could look up and see the signals from anywhere they were standing. Rauschenberg gave the first cue, and then other flashlight operators picked it up. White took his cue to change the number of flashlights switched on from the group of flashlights opposite him. As he remarked, \"There was no advance choreography, we just passed on the directions.\" [l6] Different combinations of lights represented instructions to perform simple movements: touch someone who is not touching you; hug someone quickly and move on to someone else; men, take off jackets, then replace them; and so forth. As Rauschenberg described the idea, \"The conflict of not being to see an event that is taking place right in front of one except through a reproduction is the sort of double exposure of action. A screen of light and a screen of darkness.\" [17]\r\nRauschenberg had asked each person in the crowd to say \"My name is\u2026\" into a tape recorder as he or she arrived at the Armory. This tape was then played during their performance section. But between Rauschenberg's first and second performance, the tape was accidentally erased, so he went back to an idea he had had earlier to record the \"bongs'\" during the first section of the performance and play them back during the crowd sequence.\r\nAt the end of that section in the first performance, the houselights came up slowly and the crowd followed Rauschenberg's instructions: \"Remain fixed until the lights dim down and go completely out.\" For the second performance, Rauschenberg added a third section. A single spotlight picked up the shape of a woman (Forti) in a cloth sack. She was singing an ancient Tuscan song.[18] Rauschenberg, followed by the spotlight, picked her up, carried her to another place, and put her down. He repeated this several times as she continued to sing. The piece ended when Forti stopped singing and the spotlight went out.",

        "text": "Infrared television became central to Rauschenberg's piece. His system required television pickup tubes operating in the infrared end of the spectrum, that is, sensitive to the temperature of objects. Such a system would be able to capture images of people in total darkness. I asked Larry Heilos, a research assistant at Bell Labs, to find an infrared television system for Rauschenberg. Heilos remembered:\r\nJim McGee and I dug up some surplus government sniper scopes and associated equipment. We made several quick tests. It soon became quite obvious that this gear was not going to do the job. Was there commercial gear that might be purchased? I called all the American television manufacturers, and one by one each of them told me that any good infrared equipment was held classified by the United States government. This left me with a few foreign manufacturers. Then through Norelco, I heard of a man in New Jersey, Bill Hartig, who was exploring the infrared field. He showed me several photos taken off a monitor displaying infrared-illuminated subjects. The quality was excellent. Hartig further disclosed that the infrared videcon [pickup tube] was of Japanese make and was available. It could be installed in a Norelco camera and used either in Sweden or in the United States.\r\nA demonstration date was set up to take place in April [1966] in Bob's loft on Broadway. Hartig and his son showed up in a truck loaded with equipment. The infrared camera was set up; a large spotlight with an infrared filter provided the black light. We took turns being photographed in the dark and watching ourselves on the monitor. The demonstration was a success. Everyone was excited. Steve Paxton handed me a cold bottle of beer. I looked at the label\u2014it was Japanese.[15]\r\n[...]\r\nWe moved into the Armory on October 8, and during the next five days, we installed the electrical system for the stage lights and other equipment, laid miles of cable, installed the sound system with twelve speakers in the balcony surrounding the central space, and set up bleachers for the audience.\r\nThere were endless conferences, and the artists held rehearsals as best they could. For one section of his work, which he titled Open Score (cat. no. 239), Rauschenberg used what he called, \"a modestly choreographed cast of from 300 to 500 people,\"[14] whom he found through artist Marilyn Wood and the Downtown Community School. They came to a meeting at the Armory for instructions.\r\nRauschenberg's Open Score began with a tennis game between Frank Stella and Mimi Kanarek on a full-scale tennis court laid out on the Armory Boor. As Rauschenberg wrote, \"Tennis is movement. Put in the context of theater it is a formal dance improvisation,\" But he also used the game \"to control the lights and to perform as an orchestra.\"' [15]\r\nBill Kaminski of Bell Laboratories had designed a tiny crystal-controlled FM transmitter, which could fit into the handle of a tennis racket. A contact microphone was placed at the top of the handle, and the antenna for the transmitter was wound around the racket head, We had requested and, to my surprise, received authorization from the FCC to use ten frequencies on the FM band in between the local FM stations. Of course, the transmitters had to be limited to a few milliwatts of output power.",

Tudor was operating on a fraction of what he should have had going for him. Rauschenberg's piece started very late, when it was finally decided that the automatic control of his lights just wasn't going to function [the sound from the tennis rackets was to activate the off switches on the lights]. After the second evening, and the decision to stay up all night and to get the wiring system in order, we were all right in the control room; And I still feel that if we hadn't used that wiring system, we would have had the same struggle the rest of the nine days that we had the first two. On the third day there was a meeting of the engineers at which the decision was made to go at 8:40, no matter what. Up to that time we were purists. Initially, all the artists had encouraged us in this. No artist said, \"let's fake it, let's do it by hand.\"",

        "text": "In this photograph David Tudor and Fred Waldhauer set up Tudor's piece Bandoneon! on the performance platform. Ten different types of microphones were attached to the band[o]neon and picked up the sound which was distributed to four different processing devices. The first was a forty-channel filter circuit. Twelve of its output channels were fed to the 12 speakers; the remaining channels activated relays to turn on and off spotlights on the balcony. Second, a processing circuit, which Tudor had built himself, fed four transducers attached to wood and metal structures moving on the Armory floor. The third was the 20-channel proportional control system, built by Fred Waldhauer, which controlled the intensity of eight lights mounted on the performance platform and fed the sound into different speakers around the Armory. The fourth device used the sound to modify images on the three television projectors.\r\n\r\nDavid Tudor's Bandoneon! combined sound and visual elements. In this performance photograph Tudor is seated to the left on the performance platform, specially constructed for the Armory space to hold ail the electronic equipment and then move it easily onto the floor of the Armory at the time of the performance. Behind him are Bob Kieronski, who is operating a Vocoder, which he designed and built; David Behrman; Lowell Cross, who designed and operated the system for manipulating the images on the video projector; and Fred Waldhauer, who operated his proportional control system for the performance. Two of the wooden structures, to which Tudor attached transducers, and the horn speaker moved around the Armory floor on radio-controlled carts. To the top left can be seen the television projectors and screens. One of the characteristics of the Armory was a 5-second echo, which was a problem for some of the artists. Tudor worked with this long reverberation time, and in effect used the entire Armory as his instrument.",

        "text": "Dick Wolff (tech) 11/17: Someone asked if we could turn lights on and off by remote control with no connections [this required a radio transmitter to send signals to a receiver connected to the lights). From that we realized what we had and started describing it to other artists and they started asking more questions and having other ideas. Debbie's request for remote control of eight platforms gave us the necessity for channels [because this required eight transmitters, each sending stop & go signals to a separate receiver]. So we went ahead and used the channels for other things too. Tudor and Cage used the channels extensively. Cage used them to turn speakers on and off as he walked in front of the lights. Tudor to turn on and off lights. We didn't use all the equipment to its fullest but that's for the future. After we had built that equipment, Rauschenberg's idea of the rackets came along [a transmitter attached to a tennis racket to transmit the sound of the ball hitting the racket]. And that was a good idea. We tried it out here at the labs and in fifteen minutes we knew it worked. Billy came down the hall with tennis rackets and asked me if I had a transmitter and receiver and we hooked it up and stood in the hall hitting the ball back and forth and it sounded just like it did in the show. It just required some smoothing over, hiding the transmitter and making the sound better. The fact that so much work went into communications was largely because of the influence of the engineers. You can accomplish a lot with two tin cans and a string but we're not happy with that. It's not sophisticated enough. The decoder that Robbie (Robinson) made did something that was never planned or asked for and the artists went and used it. That was the time-stepping that Cage and Tudor used [a delay mechanism by which, for instance, a light might go on a minute after receiving its \"on\" signal].\r\n[...]\r\nSchneider (tech) 11/1: What really appalled me was that On September 15th no one really knew what we were going to do on October 13th except in a very general way. Then we talked for six hours with each of the artists and then made up the drawings [diagrams of the different combinations of equipment that the different artists were going to require]. David Tudor was asking for functions I couldn't visualize. Then I made the drawing. We talked back and forth making corrections till we finally beat it into shape. I couldn't understand what he wanted until I could visualize it and he couldn't communicate it to me in those terms because he's not used to visualizing functions. When I began to get this collection of drawings, I began to realize that we'd better simplify the whole approach. That is, to program the connections, so that we could shift one artist's piece to another's without extensive replugging. [This would require something called AMP equipment which essentially is a kind of switchboard. All the non-portable audio and lighting equipment such as the power amplifiers and the power relays were to be permanently wired into this AMP equipment. Then, by inserting a different program-card or board for each performance, the appropriate connections would automatically be made. The right set-up of lights and speakers would be ready to roll.)\r\n[...]\r\nAuthor's journal, 10/8: One of the engineers said, \"What we need is a lot of unskilled labor.\" And there were two dancers and a composer - Cindy, Yvonne, and Cage - stripping wires. It occurred to me after the second day of putting tiny plugs on wires, at a table at which there were two to three artists at all times doing the same, that the activity, the situation, was an engineer-directed one. Maybe it was that our eyes and fingers had been so concentrated on those little wires for 50 long that it seemed like a world of wires. Cage said about stripping wires, \"This is very mysterious because you can't see what you're doing. You can't see what's under it. It's typical of this technology.\" Wald[h]auer said that David Tudor was \"up to his haunches in cable. He's running into the limits of wiring. He'll have to have all his equipment connected before he gets to the Armory. And then it'll take a couple of days to connect it to the Armory. We'll have to epoxy all his equipment and him to a board and bring the whole thing into the Armory in one piece.\"",

Tudor was operating on a fraction of what he should have had going for him. Rauschenberg's piece started very late, when it was finally decided that the automatic control of his lights just wasn't going to function [the sound from the tennis rackets was to activate the off switches on the lights]. After the second evening, and the decision to stay up all night and to get the wiring system in order, we were all right in the control room; And I still feel that if we hadn't used that wiring system, we would have had the same struggle the rest of the nine days that we had the first two. On the third day there was a meeting of the engineers at which the decision was made to go at 8:40, no matter what. Up to that time we were purists. Initially, all the artists had encouraged us in this. No artist said, \"let's fake it, let's do it by hand.\"",

From a small balcony high on one wall of the Armory, Rainer transmitted instructions to the performers, who wore FM pickups on their wrists, telling them to carry objects from one part of the floor to another.\r\nRainer also had preprogrammed events which were set in motion when her piece began. They included film and slide projections, a super ball dropped from the ceiling, a garbage can releasing pieces of foam rubber over the area, a lighted lucite rod travelling high over the performance area. An excerpt of a film with W.C. Fields juggling bricks was shown on a screen that collapsed.\r\nAt the end of Carriage Discreteness, Steve Paxton launched himself from the balcony on a swing attached to the ceiling, swinging back and forth until he came to a complete halt.",

He had lines open in various places in New York City including Luchow's, the Aviary, the 14th Street Con Edison electric power station, the ASPCA lost dog kennel, The New York Times press room, and Merce Cunningham's studio. Magnetic pickups on the telephone receivers fed these sound sources into the sound manipulation system. Cage also had 6 contact microphones on the performing platform itself and 12 contact microphones on household appliances such as a blender, a juicer, a toaster, a fan, etc. He also had 20 radio bands, 2 television bands, and 2 Geiger counters. Oscillators and pulse generators completed the sound sources. Thirty photocells and lights were mounted at ankle level around the performance area, which activated the different sound sources as the performers moved around. Cage invited the audience to move around freely and many stood near the performance area.",

We can tell them if what they want can be done now. Cage wants to get video through audio. People in industry would throw up their hands and say you can't do it. We have to try it out. We may lose a few dollars worth of tape. The requests are not surprising. Many are on electronics. Many are challenging, such as Fahlstrom's missile. I'm running down TV information. And I've been on the tail of a guy at Beva Electronics who says he can build infrared TV. The only thing to do is to tell the guys in industry from the very beginning what you have in mind. The cooperation has been great. I've talked with NBC on occasion and they're very cooperative.",

        "text": "Dick Wolff (tech) 11/17: Someone asked if we could turn lights on and off by remote control with no connections [this required a radio transmitter to send signals to a receiver connected to the lights). From that we realized what we had and started describing it to other artists and they started asking more questions and having other ideas. Debbie's request for remote control of eight platforms gave us the necessity for channels [because this required eight transmitters, each sending stop & go signals to a separate receiver]. So we went ahead and used the channels for other things too. Tudor and Cage used the channels extensively. Cage used them to turn speakers on and off as he walked in front of the lights. Tudor to turn on and off lights. We didn't use all the equipment to its fullest but that's for the future. After we had built that equipment, Rauschenberg's idea of the rackets came along [a transmitter attached to a tennis racket to transmit the sound of the ball hitting the racket]. And that was a good idea. We tried it out here at the labs and in fifteen minutes we knew it worked. Billy came down the hall with tennis rackets and asked me if I had a transmitter and receiver and we hooked it up and stood in the hall hitting the ball back and forth and it sounded just like it did in the show. It just required some smoothing over, hiding the transmitter and making the sound better. The fact that so much work went into communications was largely because of the influence of the engineers. You can accomplish a lot with two tin cans and a string but we're not happy with that. It's not sophisticated enough. The decoder that Robbie (Robinson) made did something that was never planned or asked for and the artists went and used it. That was the time-stepping that Cage and Tudor used [a delay mechanism by which, for instance, a light might go on a minute after receiving its \"on\" signal].\r\n[...] \r\nAuthor's journal, 10/11: I talked to Cage today. He was again crimping wires. I asked him about his piece ... was it ready? He said there was nothing he could do on it. He had already made the arrangements for getting the various materials such as the encephalographs live from the hospital, and the phones answered and left off the hook in the various places (such as Luchow's and the Bronx aviary), and the various appliances. The engineers still had work to do on equipment, which he doesn't understand. And Tudor, who is figuring out the modulations for him, is too busy working on his own piece. He had told the engineers originally what he wanted and now he was glad to accept the results that they came up with.",

        "text": "People often ask me whether new developments in art take the place of art as it used to be. My view is that far more directions for art are now available than were formerly and that no direction takes the place of another. We are, so to speak, these days richer. We have everything we used to have. The Mona Lisa, for instance, is still with us. On top of which we have the Mona Lisa with a moustache.\r\nPerhaps the central fact of Renaissance art was that the work of art sprang from a single individual's imagination.\r\nNow we have another way of making art that is less individual and more social. It is an activity that is possible only because a number of people come together and join, so to speak, forces. This festival of theater and engineering is an example. Buckminster Fuller speaks of synergy, an energy that results from several energies being combined and which is greater than their sum. Art instead of being an object made by one person becomes a process set in motion by a group of people, in this case artists and engineers. It is not someone saying something, but people doing things that give everyone (including those involved) the opportunity to have experiences they would not otherwise have had.\r\nThis way of working in groups is more and more in the air globally. In the 50's we already had the Once Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Gutai Group in Osaka and Tokyo. Now as one travels around he encounters groups so to speak wherever he goes: the Zaj Group in Madrid, Fluxus, here and abroad, Bang in Richmond, Virginia, the recent construction in Stockholm of the Hon by Niki de St. Phalle, Jean Tinguely and Per Ulveldt.\r\nNot all groups are as fortunate technologically speaking as this present New York group. That good fortune is the direct result of Billy Kluver's enthusiasm for the arts. He has brought some 25 engineers of Bell Laboratories and 10 artists of this city together and kept them together since last January.\r\nEach artist has initiated a single project. This harks back to the Renaissance but automobiles when first invented also harked back\u2014not to the Renaissance\u2014but to the horse and buggy.\r\nMy own project is simple to describe. It is a piece of music, Variation VII, indeterminate in form and detail, making use of the sound system which has been devised collectively for this festival, further making use of modulation means organized by David Tudor, using as sound sources only those sounds which are in the air at the moment of performance, picked up via the communication bands, telephone lines, microphones, together with, instead of musical instruments, a variety of household appliances and frequency generators.\r\nThe technical problems involved in any single project tend to reduce the impact of the original idea, but in being solved they produce a situation different than anyone could have pre-imagined.",

        "text": "vehicle\r\nby: Lucinda Childs\r\nperformance engineer: Peter Hirsch\r\ncast: William Davis, Alex Hay\r\nslides by: Les Levine\r\n\r\n\tVehicle consists of materials animate, inanimate, air-supported (in one instance), which can exist in a non-static state and be observed in increased dimension as they come in contact with light and sound sources made available consistently or intermittedly by radio signals through-out the dance.\r\n\tThe Doppler sonar has ultrasonic beam sources and a receiver. The beam emits frequencies at a level which is greater than our hearing capacity. A moving figure or object passing in front of the beam interrupts it and sends frequencies back to the receiver of the sonar at a level determined by the velocity of the figure or object. What we hear is the proportional difference between the frequencies sent out and those returned through interruption of the beam, and the resulting reduction in the frequency level is what makes the sonar audible. Middle C (as we know it in music) is supposed to occur at approximately three feet per second of movement. This device, however, picks up movement of any duration or speed at the exact time that it begins or ends.\r\n\tThe ground effect machine is made from a General Motors refrigerator part which is designed as a platform to raise the 440 lb. weight of a refrigerator a fraction of an inch off the ground by the intake of air from a vacuum cleaner, thus making it possible to move the 440 lbs. with ease. The engineer, Per Biorn, installed two vacuum cleaner motors onto this platform so that I am in effect on a cushion of air when I use it.\r\n\tI intend to utilize these devices in a set of circumstances as instruments which may or may not be efficient to the notion of completing anything. I do not feel that dance should be limited to the display of physical exertion alone; anything that can exist in a non-static state for a certain duration of time is of interest to me. My ideas are generally derived from the laws which govern the materials themselves and I attempt to allow the qualities and limitations of materials to be exposed in different situations.",

T : technicians who will be mainly concerned.\r\n1. 500 kc doppler sonar to pick up ordinary motion by the body. Beat frequency should be directly audible. A: Childs T: Coker, Klu\u0308ver\r\n2.\"Cocktailpartyeffect\" Many (50 ? , 100 ?) speakers of low power placed on walls or around the room, or outside.Each speaker giving a different sound. What is the minimum amount of tape recorders that need be used? How many channels can be put on one tape? A: Paxton T : Mc Gee end others.\r\n3. Stretch rubber or fabric in two directions so that area is multiplied many times. Probably use textured yarn and have commercial knitter make fabric to specification. A: D. Hay T: Wagner and others.\r\n4. Use of air wall. Find out what is commercially available. Is it possible to make the wall opaque by adding powder to the airstream? How large do the air walls come? A; D. Bay and Mothers T: ?\r\n5. Jello in which parts of the body can be immersed. A:Fahlstr\u00f6m T: Winslow and others.\r\n6. Clouds. Solid and otherwise. Use of styrene foams is possible if they are hollowed. And filled with helium. One liter helium can lift one gram, one liter foam weighs 1.5 grams. A: Fahlstr\u00f6m and others. T ?\r\n7. Gases. Which gases are nontoxic and innocent and affect people? ( Helium). A: Fahlstr\u00f6m T : ?\r\n8. Alex Hay wants to be raised. How can this be done? Compressed air, foam, or what? A: A.Hay T: ?\r\n9. Subsonic sounds. A: Fahlstr\u00f6m T: ?\r\n10. Large ( more than ten feet ) mirrors made up of aluminized mylar, circular and stre[t]ched. The radius of curvature of the mirror can be changed continuously by applying pressure or vacuum behind aluminized sheeth. A: Paxton T : ?\r\n11. All body functions which relate to use of energy: Use of CO., swaet, ECG, breathing to be converted into sound. A: Childs T : ?\r\n12. 10 - 12 FM transmitters and rec[ei]vers which can be used for audio as well as switching . Price about 50 dollars / piece. A : all T : all\r\n13. Battery driven photocell with relay A : all T : ?\r\n14. Powerpak. What is the maximum power which can be obtained during ten minutes from batteries and which weights less than 30 pounds? A : Paxton. D.Hay T : ? Cannot be liquid batteries.\r\n15. Time compression and extension. The recording of an actual event can either be speeded up of slowed down and shown instantaneously, at the same time as the event occurs. Use of tv or film? A: Whitman, Childs, T: ?\r\n16: Feedback. Use of feedback through speakers and mikes carried by people to create variable sound A: Rauschenberg. T: Coker and others.\r\n17. Infrared tv. Find out what tv pickup tubes are available on the market. What frequencies do body and other objects emit? What infrared light sources are available? How strong? The room in which the action occurs should be \"dark\" to visible light. Forms of rebroadcast: snooperscopes, tv sets, Eidaphor. A: Rauschenberg T: Heilos and others\r\n18. Instant heat and cold. Use of infrared sources and liquid air. A: Whitman and others T : ?\r\n19. Low frequency transmission loops, simple and with low definition. Each of the spectators to carry a receiver. A : some T : ?\r\n20. Debbie Hay wants to be able to approach two objects (comb and hair, knife and fork / and connect a sound source (tape recorder) . In how many ways could such a switch be made? A : D.Hay T : ?\r\n21. Fahlstr\u00f6m and Rauschenberg want to float, suspended in air. A: Rauschenberg Fahlstr\u00f6m T: Hailos\r\nThis list does not contain suggestions from [C]age or Tudor. They are out of town and will be back shortly.\r\n\r\n2nd list Feb 20,1966\r\n22. Doppler sonar. Display of velocity of moving objects. A. Lucinda Childs T: Coker.\r\n23. Change frequency of heart beat - transform up or down. Use of filter. A: Fahlstr\u00f6m T:?\r\n24. Transform words. (Frequency, amplitude, filter) A: Paxton T: ?\r\n25. Control objects at distance A : Fahlstr\u00f6m\r\n26. One or more floating forms following man that moves. A : Fahlstr\u00f6m\r\n27. Activate objects at distance with vortex gun, heat, light beam. A: Fahlstr\u00f6m.\r\n28. Photocells sensitive to light on movie or tv screen, A : Fahlstr\u00f6m.\r\n29. Suspension in air by 30 m3 of helium or rocket belt. A Fahlstr\u00f6m\r\n30. Balloons coming out of hat. Like thought balloons. A Fahlstr\u00f6m\r\n31. Clouds. A Fahlstr\u00f6m\r\n32. Display on large screen of image under microscope. A: Fahlstr\u00f6m.\r\n33. Write on wall with laser beam? Fluorescent material? A: Fahlstr\u00f6m.\r\n\r\n3rd list March 1,1966 (following 5th meeting )\r\n34. It appears possible that impulses from flexing of muscles can be used to trigger switches (in connection with proposed wireless system for instance). Suggestion by Jim Mc Gee. T. Coker A. ?\r\n35. Use of vocoder to transform voice sounds. Application in Debbies dance where the sound of combing ones hair will be heard as doves. There will be a taping session in which we will have a[c]cess to the vocoder. T. Coker A ? (Fahlstr\u00f6m)\r\n36. Red laser-light reflected back and forth across floor. Smoke to make light visible. T. Klu\u0308ver. A Debbie\r\n37. Changing colors. Needs moisture and acid. Change from colorless situation to color. Should be investigated. T. Winslow A (many)\r\n38. Variation of 37.

        "text": "In Robert Whitman's Two Holes of Water - 3 seven cars, carrying film and television projectors, drove onto the Armory floor and parked facing the back wall which was covered with white paper. On the balcony, television cameras shot performers Trisha Brown and Mimi Stark moving slowly in front of a curved mirror; and another shot Jackie Leavitt typing. On the Armory floor another camera shot Susanna di Maria pouring water and Les Levine ued a small fiber optic video camera inside his coat pocket Whitman fed the images of these live performances and off-air television images to the television projectors in the cars. He also cued the drivers to turn on nature films and films he had made himself, including a film that superimposed the back and front of a girl as she performed simple movements. Ken Dewey, high up in the winch hoist projected films onto a white screen on the floor. Contact microphones on the tailpipe of a car and on the typewriter and a Bertrand Russell speech were some of the sounds resounding through the Armory.\r\n",

Chemicals developed by the new technology permit me to use elements formerly not possible\u2014an object gradually changing color, \"snow bubbles\" rising from the ground, people enveloped by \"clouds.\" By utilizing our Internal broadcasting system, I can have pillows sing out while they are bounced on the floor or thrown In the air. By utilizing our remote control system, I can have an actor pursued by an air-borne object or direct the same object to approach floating targets.\r\nOn another level, my piece deals with machine-like qualities in people: robot-like people capable of memorizing enormous amounts of data or of making multidigit calculations In their heads (as found In psychiatric literature); the risk of putting \"robots\" (narrow minds) in situations for which they are not \"programmed\"\u2014 i.e., crisis situations\u2014and machines getting out of control.\r\nJuxtaposed with this are glimpses of everyday events and characters of the world of today. Bob Hope and Mao Tse Tung appear In New York City street demonstrations, for example. For this we will use films of an actual demonstration along with tapes of the reactions of the people who see it. Tape and film become a part of the piece.\r\nNew York, China, Indonesia, the bottom of the sea, space, the world of the future (as seen In a science fiction movie)\u2014all are Interwoven into a triptych of slide, movie, and television screens. There is no explanation. The spectator draws conclusions or not, as he chooses.\r\nI think of it as initiation rites for a new medium, Total Theater.",

        "text": "Oyvind Fahlstrom: I'm interested in enlarging and renewing conventional theatre. In combining different aspects of one thing that is going on. Different angles. Closeups. I want to pick up and highlight details. In theatre it's usually hard to convey anything but large clear goings on. I've been interested in details in the past. In Sweden I did a piece in which I used the image of pricking skin with a pin. Of course, few people in the audience could see it. Now you can pick things like this up (with closed circuit TV) and get a many-faceted impression.",

        "text": "Jim McGee (technician) 3/9: I called Steve (Paxton) a few times. There's a lack of understanding by the scientists of what the artists want. They would accept a lot of things but it's a question of what they would prefer. For example, Harold H. is building Fahlstrom's antimissilemissile (a balloon which follows a performer around). He was working hard to make a rectangular balloon. I suggested he make it round. Harold called Fahlstrom who said that was even better. I can see the other side; it's difficult to know what the finished product will look like. \r\n[...]\r\nLarry Heilos (tech) 4/5: The artists shouldn't feel restricted in their demands. We can tell them if what they want can be done now. Cage wants to get video through audio. People in industry would throw up their hands and say you can't do it. We have to try it out. We may lose a few dollars worth of tape. The requests are not surprising. Many are on electronics. Many are challenging, such as Fahlstrom's missile. I'm running down TV information. And I've been on the tail of a guy at Beva Electronics who says he can build infrared TV. The only thing to do is to tell the guys in industry from the very beginning what you have in mind. The cooperation has been great. I've talked with NBC on occasion and they're very cooperative.",

Chemicals developed by the new technology permit me to use elements formerly not possible\u2014an object gradually changing color, \"snow bubbles\" rising from the ground, people enveloped by \"clouds.\" By utilizing our internal broadcasting system, I can have pillows sing out while they are bounced on the floor or thrown in the air. By utilizing our remote control system, I can have an actor pursued by an airborne object or direct the same object to approach floating targets.\r\nOn another level, my piece deals with machine-like qualities in people: robot-like people capable of memorizing enormous amounts of data or of making multidigit calculations in their heads (as found in psychiatric literature); the risk of putting \"robots\" (narrow minds) in situations for which they are not \"programmed\"\u2014 i.e., crisis situations\u2014and machines getting out of control.\r\nJuxtaposed with this are glimpses of everyday events and characters of the world of today. Bob Hope and Mao Tse Tung appear in New York City street demonstrations, for example. For this we will use films of an actual demonstration along with tapes of the reactions of the people who see it. Tape and film become a part of the piece. New York, China, Indonesia, the bottom of the sea, space, the world of the future (as seen in a science fiction movie)\u2014all are interwoven into a triptych of slide, movie, and television screens. There is no explanation. The spectator draws conclusions or not, as he chooses. I think of it as initiation rites for a new medium, Total Theater.",

On November 30, 1966, we called a meeting at the Central Plaza Hotel on lower Broadway in New York to determine the amount of interest the artists had in this idea. Three hundred artists came to the meeting, and we collected eighty immediate requests for technical help. We realized that our first task was to interest more engineers in working with artists.",

These collaborations made it possible for artists to pursue ideas that required the use of new technology, and the work could develop in directions that neither the artist or the engineer could have foreseen. We also believed that these collaborations could lead technology in directions more positive for the needs, desires, and pleasures of the individual. We developed the Technical Services Program, whose principal activity was to match artists who had technical problems or projects with engineers or scientists who could work with them. Over the years E.A.T. has helped thousands of artists who approached us for technical assistance. In 1967 Fred Waldhauer and L.J. Robinson collaborated with Rauschenberg on his large interactive sculpture Soundings. In this photograph Robinson, center, talks with Rauschenberg, to the right, during the installation of Soundings at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.",

        "text": "In a silent space Soundings is a mirror, eight feet high and thirty-six feet long. Behind the partially mirrorized front layer are two layers of plexiglass with images of wooden chairs silkscreened on them. Different lights behind the sheets of plexiglass are triggered by sounds in the room so that sets of lights go on, and illuminated images of chairs are seen through the mirror. Technically, Soundings works by having the sound signal from microphones hung in front of the panels split into four frequency bands, chosen to correspond to the pitch of different human voices. The signal from each frequency band controls a set of thirty-six 150-watt spotlights. and the brightness of the lights varies in intensity based on the volume of the sound. Thus, one frequency band activates nine lights throughout the piece; and soft sounds will produce a low light level.",

        "text": "REMARKS BY BILLY KL\u00dcVER\r\nPresident\r\nExperiments in Art and Technology\r\nNew York, New York\r\n\r\nExperiments in Art and Technology is not organized for the benefit of the artist.\r\n\r\nExperiments in Art and Technology in a real sense is a revolutionary process to catalyze the individual's responsibility for the shaping of the new technology. We can no longer claim innocence for the human and social consequences resulting from technological change. We are, in all respects, responsible for the technology that will form our environment tomorrow. This responsibility implies the search for a technology directed towards pleasure and enjoyment. It implies an awareness of the distinction between functional and ecological aspects of technology. It implies that the inherent authority of a medium is recognized so that exploration rather than education can be emphasized. It implies that we expand and enrich technology in a conscious way. it implies the elimination of the distinction between work and leisure.\r\n\r\nE.A.T. will stimulate this awareness within industry, labor, the technical community, politics and the arts by developing an effective method of collaboration between artists and engineers. The artist functions autonomously. His constraints are physical. His subject matter is the relation of the human being to the world. The engineer works within a group. His work is bounded by economic consideration, existing investments in equipment and regulatory standards. The raison d'etre of E.A.T. is that the collaboration may yield a work which is neither the preconception of the engineer nor the artist but a result of the human interaction between their two areas.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations of the artist-engineer interaction will become known through professional channels such as articles in technical journals, technical conferences and the formation of professional groups for Engineering in Art. Our alliance with the American Foundation on Automation and Employment will considerably expand E.A.T. 's dialogue with labor and industry. In the Foundation's building on East 68th Street, we will be able to make use of the latest technical equipment for performances and exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe collaborative projects will explore new and relevant uses of technology, they will give the artist and the engineer a new awareness and insight, and they will require the positive involvement of industrial leadership, labor and politics. This interaction will generate a fusing of specializations from which a new responsibility will emerge.\r\n\r\nWe are asking all of you here from the press, industry, politics, labor, the arts and the technical community to recognize and share in this responsibility which forms the base of E.A. T. and to lend your authority and sympathy in support of our enterprise.",

KENIN\r\nPresident\r\nAmerican Federation of Musicians\r\n\r\nIt has been said that \"a people can never be fully civilized until the economy is the servant of the peoples culture and not the master. \" Today, with the formation of E.A.T. , we affirm once again that the knowledge of the scientist can and must be wedded in the effort of enriching and ennobling the life of Man. The skills of the engineer and scientist are meant for more than supporting an endless flow of gadgetry; the talents of actor, musician and painter must have a greater place in the scheme of our society than that of helping to sell soap, tail fins and hair pins. When these men and women are not assisted in their efforts to make their fullest contribution, then not only is their dignity as human beings diminished but the worth of our civilization is seriously lessened as well.\r\n\tE.A.T. will offer such assistance and because it does, it has my whole-hearted support and interest.\r\n\tI am here today representing the council of AFL-CIO Unions For SPACE. The Council is a new organization, younger, in fact, than E.A.T. It comprises 18 international unions representing many hundreds of thousands of professional employees throughout our land. These people are teachers, librarians, engineers, nurses, actors, dancers, singers and musicians. They are technicians and artists who will benefit from the work of E.A.T. , and they are also the audience and patrons who will enjoy the products of E.A.T. 's efforts.\r\n\tAs practitioners in the arts and sciences, the membership of our constituent unions are concerned about the growing chasm between the disciplines as compartmentilizations and specializations become increasingly the rule in our organization of industries and the economy. As engineers, scientists, and artists, the members of AFL-CIO unions are concerned by the growing impersonalization of their work and by the frustrations they face in attempting to employ their knowledge and talents in making what they might consider a valid contribution to our civilization.\r\n\tAs audiences and consumers, the membership of our unions are concerned that the products they buy, the entertainment they see, the environment in which they find themselves during the growing period of time they can spend away from their work place are so unfulfilling and unrepresentative of the best of which our society is capable.\r\n\tIn our council we will bring together many dedicated professionals. We will concern ourselves not only with their working environment so that they can make their fullest contributions in their professions, but, also, with the quality of society to which they are asked to contribute their knowledge and talents. The work of E. A. T. will have an impact in both areas. Those who are employed as engineers and artists \u2014 the many hundreds of thousands who are represented in our council \u2014 welcome the opportunity to work with E.A.T.",

Man cannot live without art. Sometimes it seems that our culture and our lives are becoming fragmented. I am happy that dedicated and talented people are bringing art and technology together through experimentation, which is a common ground to both.\r\n\tBilly Kl\u00fcver, Robert Rauschenberg and their colleagues have succeeded surprisingly in arousing interest among capable men in a variety of fields. They have established an organization and have found gratifying financial support for making a promising start.\r\n\tThis bold new venture deserves whatever help people can give it. Surely, art cannot safely ignore or reject such a powerful force as technology. And, technology should not be without art. Technology is a tool which we should use toward social and creative ends.\r\n\tBridging the gap between art and technology is not easy. Backgrounds, knowledge and expectations are different. If they are to succeed, artists must learn to use the possible, and technologists must reach out for the impossible. E.A.T. is providing a mechanism and avenue for mutual understanding and cooperation. It is up to artists, technologists and those who appreciate and support their efforts to see that E.A.T. succeeds.",

GROSS\r\nPresident\r\nCommerce and Industry Association\r\n\r\n\tAlong with its obligation to be a profit maker for its owners, the modern business corporation has an obligation to be a good citizen in the community. As a basic part of this obligation, the corporation must examine carefully its responsibility to support the arts. In the past ten years, business has recognized its debt as a social institution by increasing steadily its support of education, health and welfare organizations.\r\n\tUnfortunately, however, business has not generally accepted the arts as a proper area for its support. A National Industrial Conference Board Survey showed that American corporations in 1965 allocated less than three-fifths of each contributed dollar to the arts, for a grand total of just under 25 million dollars. Such major firms as IBM, Chase Manhattan Bank, S.C. Johnson & Son, Hallmark Cards, Inland Steel and several others have already provided outstanding leadership in supporting the visual and performing arts \u2014 but not enough corporations have followed their leadership.\r\n\tIn a major speech to the NICB last year, Mr. David Rockefeller proposed that we establish a Council on Business and the Arts to stimulate corporate financial contributions to the arts. This would parallel the job being done for business aid to education by the Council for Financial Aid to Education Organization several years ago. I understand that Mr. Rockefeller has developed over the past few weeks and that there will be an announcement on a council in support of the arts very shortly. I urge our business corporations to give full support to this project.",

        "text": "REMARKS BY WARREN BRODEY*\r\nDirector of M.I.T. Science Camp\r\n\r\n\tThe first industrial revolution averaged the people; if you are willing to be like the many: dress alike, eat pre-prepared foods, life is made simpler. If you are famous or poor, you are allowed individual expression. You must deserve to make it. You must fill in the blanks if your individual existence is to be recognized. There is a limit to the number of blanks that can be handled by the system. Personal creativeness is interpreted as angry, or, rendered meaningless by the complications one must face to make it work. It is drained by complications.\r\n\tIn the days when the controls of our society had to be simplified; when mass transportation could allow only limited variation if it were to be available, when design of products for the many meant they must all be alike \u2014- to be cheap \u2026 in those times, man had to be averaged. But today, the many -- both people and products are in a traffic jam.\r\n\tThe new technology provides an implication sensed by the many as they are bombarded by proud news of technological adventures: individuals can learn to play with technology. Individuals who are not mechanically inclined can design their our experiences by using the new variability that industry could provide if there were enough demands to make this economically feasible. But demand develops only as it is shown that there is something new to be demanded. The computer-assisted factory begins to provide large number productions with versatility in products and a man-machine relation more like that of the small shop.\r\n\tThere is a new potential for living in a personalized environment if we merely can think our way out of the mass production mentality and into the immense choice and fun that industry's new talents and technology can make available. Imagine having many, many forms of transportation designed to different uses, personal tastes and esthetic styles.\r\n\tIt is the artist who has the capacity to create this variability and to use and to make relevant what is outside the \"accepted systems. \" He can point out relationships that were not seen before. The artist can create the surprises that foreshadow great new cultural inventions to match our technical advances. But like the technologist, the artist must unlearn his obsolescence and intensely sense the relevance of the new technology as a source of raw material.\r\n\tIt is by using the language and media of technology that the artist will help us to understand the technology with which we live. Artistry and industry together can help create a people-oriented technology. In the joint execution of this search, each hints insights to the other and there becomes a sense of fresh existence to be experienced. I believe people will want in. They will want the participation in invention that makes technology friendly. They will want to swim in the stream that joins traditional engineering and art. Simply bridging the gap between these formal disciplines is not the same as getting people into the action.\r\n        Neither individuals, nor companies, nor groups of artists can afford to go too far off the beaten track to often. The cost of modern experimentation without a clear demand is too high. Experiments in Art and Technology has achieved a most exciting way to use new versatility and to show what can be done.\r\n\r\n*This is the personal statement by the author, and, in no way necessarily represents the view of any institute he may be affiliated with.",

        "text": "REMARKS BY ROBERT MORRIS\r\nArtist\r\n\r\nMy relation to E. A.T. has been an external one. I have known some of the people who have been most intimately involved with its development, but I myself have been outside it. I have participated in its projects only indirectly. So what speculations or reflections I can make are necessarily those of an observer.\r\n\r\nFirst I should say something about my own particular experience with technology. It is the development of my own work, sculpture, in relation to industry that enables me to say anything in particular about the relationship. And, my experience and the generalization I can make may not be at all relevant to those who have worked directly with E.A.T. In the beginning, I merely intended to use industry to implement certain ideas I had which were fairly clear in my own mind. I knew what I wanted and it was simply a matter of finding someone to build it. This approach changed in proportion to what I found out about how things got made. It became less and less a matter of being in a studio thinking of things, making the plans and sending them off to the fabricator. More and more it became a matter of incorporating methods and materials I had found out about in the process of being related to particular fabricators. The process of working became more direct and also more complex \u2014 involving as it would not only the ever increasing acquisition of technical information but also the development of a social and executive sense which had not been necessary when I made the work myself in the studio. Working became a very extended situation of making appointments, visiting factories and gathering information. The more I found out and the more people I met who were interested in helping, the less it seemed necessary to plan everything either precisely or completely in advance. More work got made easier by leaving certain problems open for others to work out. I began accepting solutions suggested by others which showed up in the finished work in very specific ways \u2014 and in ways which I had not preconceived. More possibilities occur[r]ed. In short, less, not more, control was becoming desirable. The process of making art began to get ever so slightly corporate.\r\n\r\nRemarks by Robert Morris - 2\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting to me about E.A. T. is that it seems to be a pretty maximum resource for a much more extended kind of corporate making. This is just a speculation, and maybe it will turn out to be relevant. \"Dialogue\" between the artist and engineer is talked about, but, for the most part, what I have seen has had the traditional individualistic orientation with the artist in control demanding that the product be the projection of his images. The Nine Evenings seemed like this, except for some interesting mistakes. I think that I myself still adhere to the values of individualistic art and maintain a fairly tight control of the end product in spite of some developments away from this. Most artists I know work this way. Possibly it is the way most will continue to work, but I think this type product control is being questioned by younger people. It is also true that most periods of high individualistic art are politically unstable, even corrupt, and sometimes philosophically stagnet as well \u2014- the Renaissance or now would be an example. It is obvious that these things are not going unnoticed by younger people. I think the broader awareness and more extended involvement in social, political as well as artistic action indicates a less professionalistic, less specialist, less product-oriented tendency. Possibly these people will be able to utilize the facilities E.A.T. offers for a more extended way of working which involves the cooperation and initiative of many. But if this is true, I do not know what is possible in these new terms. It would be boring to try to predict its nature. It would seem that getting many unlikely things tried would be more relevant than demanding particular successes.\r\n\r\nI hope E.A.T. can maintain and develop roots in many extended processes and connect to many diverse people. By being open, available and diverse, it will be a means that has not existed before. Out of such means, things we cannot predict should develop.",

Local Groups began to spring up spontaneously as artists and engineers in areas outside New York contacted us wanting to set up artist-engineer collaborations to work with the new technology. We encouraged people to start Local Groups and gave them information and advice. By 1968 there were 28 E.A.T. Local Groups active in the U.S. and Canada, 4 in Europe and one in South America. In June 1968 we held an international conference at the loft in New York for E.A.T. representatives to meet and discuss ideas for organization and activities in their areas.\r\nWe also went on speaking tours to colleges and universities and visited Local Group meetings. In this photograph, I am speaking to a group in Toronto. Behind me is a projection of the first technical requests from the artists for 9 EVENINGS.",

        "text": "It was assumed that E.A.T.'s technical services should be handled by engineers and modeled after the practices of technical societies. This was in part to remain open to any artist regardless of his fame or aesthetic preference and to be regarded as a professional  engineering society. [1]\r\nWith these ends in mind, E.A.T. aimed to establish contacts with the American Physical Society, Engineers Joint Council, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and other technical societies. They were contacted for E.A.T.'s own membership, use of their membership lists for direct mailings to prospective technical members, or the publication of articles on E.A.T. and artist/engineer projects.\r\nIn December 1966, Billy Kluver had begun plans to form an \"Engineering for Art Group\" [2] within the IEEE, a technical society with membership divided geographically into regions and technically into groups. It was hoped that the group would encourage having artists relate to society through a specific profession, that engineers would work on projects as challenging and difficult as their \"normal\" engineering problems, that the engineers' work would remain professional as defined by the technical society to be useful to artists, and that their technical contributions would be professionally recognized, this being considered essential to establish their role in collaboration.\r\nGiven encouragement from the IEEE, which at first found the idea \"very freshing,\" Klu\u0308ver outlined the rationale for forming the group before the New Technical and Scientific Activities Committee of the IEEE on March 21, 1967.\r\nKluver argued that the intellectual community, unlike the technical community, was aware of the artists' \"intense but unsatisfied desire to use technology as a material\"; that the capacity of technology was greater than what people were willing to recognize and, unlike pre-television times, one could now ask \"what should the next mass media look like?\"; that engineers had \"become responsible for the character of our technical environment\"; and that \"to help make the technical environment of the future more varied, imaginative on a different level of human activity,\" engineers needed the interaction which artists were  proposing. If the engineer were rational and the artist irrational, their collaboration would suggest new uses of technology and eventually lead to a new kind of technology.\r\nThe group was to perform three functions as given in Kluver's talk. First, it would provide focus outside the art community on specific technical problems and feedback of artists' problems into an engineering vocabulary. Second, It would deal not only with artists' technical problems but human problems resulting from artist/engineer relationships and make the engineer aware of the artist's language. Third, it would publish its transactions.\r\nIn concluding his talk, Kluver suggested the IEEE was facing \"an historical decision.\" It did \"not look like much on the surface\" but could become \"a challenge for the IEEE to bring the two cultures together again.\"\r\nThe IEEE considered the situation atypical and suggested forming a subgroup rather than a full-fledged professional group. They asked what the group's functions would be, what financial and other support would be required, how leadership would be selected and reviewed, what the membership qualifications would be for non-engineers, and what assurance could be given that the group be centered on electronics and electrical engineers and that their contributions be maintained at a professional level.\r\nReference to the group's formation appeared throughout the 1967 issues of E.A.T. News. One of the persons asked to assist in forming the group was Cyril M. Harris of Columbia University.\r\n\r\n1. Kluver, \"Report to the Board,\" May 25, 1967, and E.A.T. News. June 1, 1967, p.4.\r\n2. The group was also called \"Engineering in Art\" and \"Art in Engineering\" in E.A.T. News. June 1, 1967, pp.3 and 14. The following statements about the group are from Kluver's notes and correspondence with Richard M. Emberson, director of technical services, et al. at the IEEE, December 1966-April 1967.",

Acoustic, vibrations passing through a latex membrane in a' black, windowed cube activated particles of red dust that swirled in the rays of a small Kleiglight. The source of the vibrations was a taped recording of heartbeats.\r\n\tOne of the engineers of \"Dust,\"' Ralph Martel, then rigged up a stethoscope to provide the vibrations and, testing his own beat, which thumped noticeably louder, than the taped beats, said \"first prize\" smilingly.\r\n\tAfter stethoscoped spectators took their turn at making the dust dance, the first of the two second-prize winners, the lights still dim for maximum visual effect, was set in action.\r\n\t\"Cybernetic Sculpture,\" groupings of vibrating stainless steel rods illuminated by strobe lights whose flashes respond to the variations of sounds created by the audience, drew laughs when the oscillations gave the illusion of burlesque gyrations.\r\n\tEnthusiasm for the third work, \"Fakir in 3/4 Time,\" was perhaps the strongest. A motor-driven loop of textile tape, which like the loop of a lariat remains rigid in motion, soared like a Brancusi bird, twisted into a moebius band and wheeled into an ellipse, as it was manipulated by its - engineer, Niels O. Young. Mr. Young's children were on hand to jump through some of the loop formations.\r\n\tAlso on hand was Theodore W. Kheel, the labor lawyer and multimedia mediator who heads the American Foundation on Automation and Employment, donor of the first prize.\r\n\tMr. Kneel emphasized that the prizes were for the engineers involved, and not the artists, in the three works.\r\n\tThey are Harris Hyman and Mr. Martel for \"Dust\"; Frank T. Turner for \"Cybernetic Sculpture\" and Mr. Young - for \"Fakir.\"\r\n\tThe competition was arranged by Experiments in Art and Technology, which is dedicated to preserving and strengthening the marriage.",

        "text": "FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPETITION AND THE REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF WORKS OF ART IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXHIBITION \"THE MACHINE\" AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR E.A.T. INVOLVEMENT\r\n\r\nTo stimulate professional scientists and engineers to collaborate with contemporary artists.\r\nTo bring the realization over to the technical community of the massive interest among contemporary artists in the new technology.\r\nTo promote the value and significance of the technical contribution to a work of art in the technical and art communities.\r\nTo increase the access by artists to the latest technology.\r\n\r\nTHE EXHIBITION\r\n\r\n\"The Museum of Modern Art, New York, has asked Experiments in Art and Technology to collaborate on a section dedicated to new technology in art as an extension of a major exhibition entitled THE MACHINE, to be held in the fall of I968 and directed by K.G.P. Hulten, Director of Moderna Museet, Stockholm. The main body of the exhibition will be an historical survey of works of art commenting on the machine and the mechanical world. Works to be considered for inclusion in the exhibition should be submitted by June 1, I968 to Experiments in Art and Technology.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of works involving the new technology selected for the exhibition will be approximately ten. They must be of a \"medium size\" to fit into the space at the Museum of Modern Art. Since physical size is in many cases an inaccurate measurement, applicants are advised to use their own judgment.\r\n\r\nThe works submitted can result out of a collaboration between artist and engineer or be made by either alone. They must, however, incorporate the use of new technology such as the use of computers, new materials, electronics, and structural engineering. The section dedicated to the new technology comprises contemporary works of art and does not form part of the main theme of the exhibition which is \"an historical survey of works of art commenting on THE MACHINE and the mechanical world\".\r\n\r\nAll artists and engineers who would like to submit works to the exhibition should fill out the enclosed form as soon as possible and mail it to Experiments in Art and Technology, 9 East 16th Street, New York, New York 10003.\r\n\r\nThe procedure for viewing the works will be worked out during the spring of I968, and artists and engineers will be advised accordingly. No works should be brought or sent to E.A.T. before this time.\r\n\r\nA catalog of submitted works with brief descriptions will be published.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPETITION\r\n\r\nIn connection with the request for submission or works to THE MACHINE exhibition, E.A.T. \"announces a competition for the best contribution by an engineer to a work of art produced in collaboration with an artist. The project may be initiated by either an artist or an engineer. Experiments in Art and Technology will grant a first-place award of $3,000 and two second-place awards of $1,000 each to the engineer for his technical contribution to the collaboration. The jury will consist of scientists and engineers from the technical community who are not necessarily familiar with contemporary art. The jury will not be informed about the names of the collaborating engineers. The awards will be for the most inventive use of new technology as it evolves through the collaboration of artist and engineer\".\r\n\r\nCommercial products, display signs, architectural models, discotheque lighting, technical equipment and other objects which cannot be recognized as works of art by those \"familiar with the field\" are excluded from the Competition.\r\n\r\nThe jury will be made familiar with various aspects of the collaboration between an artist and an engineer such as the different working environment for the engineer in his collaboration with an artist. The jury will not be given any esthetic advise and will be instructed to disregard esthetic preferences. The jury's decision must be unanimous and it is binding.\r\n\r\nE.A.T. will not ask for detailed information about proposed projects. Any such information offered to facilitate finding a partner will be kept in confidence.\r\n\r\nTo enable artists and engineers to meet and discuss projects, informal meetings will be held every Sunday, 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. at 9 East loth Street.\r\n\r\nFurther clarifications will be mailed to participants if necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease contact E.A.T. headquarters if you have any further questions, telephone 212 242-8803.\r\n\r\n",

Competition \"for the best contribution by an engineer to a work of art produced in collaboration with an artist,\" works must be the result of a collaboration between an artist and an engineer or groups of artists and engineers. All works submitted by June 1, 1968, will be considered for the M.O.M.A. Exhibition, but only collaborative works will be considered for the E.A.T. Competition.\r\n\r\nDeadline for submission of entries to both the E.A.T. Competition and the M.O.M.A. Exhibition is June 1, 1968.\r\nWorks must be completed and available for viewing by that date.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR E.A.T COMPETITION\r\n\r\nOn or before June 1, the following information must be sent to E.A.T., 9-East 16th Street, New York, New York, 10003:\r\n\r\n\ta. Detailed technical report by the engineer, describing his contribution to the collaboration. This may include technical drawings or diagrams.\r\n\tb. Photographs, slides, or\u2014if desired\u20148mm or 16mm film of the work.\r\n\tc. The enclosed information blank should be filled out completely and sent in with the above material. The name of the engineer should not appear on any other material submitted. Jury members will not know the names of the collaborating engineers.\r\n\r\nDo not send or bring works to E.A.T. You will be contacted to arrange date, time and place for viewing. Because of the wide geographical spread of the entries, and limited time, several local viewing centers will be set up\u2014for example New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and others if necessary. Participants in the competition will be advised when and where their work will be seen. All shipping costs required must be paid by the collaborators and not by E.A.T.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no restriction on size, weight, or medium of entries to the E.A.T. Competition, our original designation of \"medium size\" was to suggest that works should be transportable and easily exhibited.\r\n\r\nCommercial products, display signs, architectural models, discotheque lighting, technical equipment, and other objects which cannot be recognized as works of art by those \"familiar with the field\" are not eligible for the Competition. Engineers or artists involved in more than one collaborative project may submit all their projects to the Competition. The names of the Competition jurors will remain anonymous until final selections are made.",

More interested in the energy than in questioning what was or was not art, and in a spirit of advocacy, E.A.T. decided to show all the works at an exhibition concurrent with \"The Machine.\"\r\n\tThe exhibition's title, \"Some More Beginnings,\" came from discussions at Robert Rauschenberg's place. Knowing that the New York art community was always anxious to label such events, E.A.T. did not want the exhibition \"to seem to be the answer to what E.A.T. was,\" as Francis Mason recalls, but \"some more beginnings of what could come.\"\r\n\tHaving considered various places in Manhattan\u2014the Marlboro Gerson Gallery, the Union Carbide show room, the old General Motors Building, and Automation House (still in renovation)\u2014and liking the idea of a show in Brooklyn, E.A.T. made arrangements with Thomas Buechner, director of the Brooklyn Museum, for use of the museum's West Gallery and Sculpture Court.",

        "text": "Robert Breer, the first artist to become involved with the Pavilion, makes motorized sculpture; pure forms that move about quietly and mysteriously. He calls them \"floats\" or, with some self irony, \"automobiles\" since his father was the celebrated designer of the Chrysler Airflow. He is also a well-known filmmaker. In his film work, Breer aims for \"very intense activity in a small area\" to force the viewer into visual concentration and he has steered away from multi projection and multimedia works which he believes overwhelm the senses. According to Breer, the usual result of multimedia is scattered razzle-dazzle without articulation and form. This taste for a subtle, quiet experience was shared by the other artists in the Pavilion Project. It is mainly for this reason the Pavilion was not planned as a multimedia work. Although its elements have been drawn from different technologies, the aim of the collaboration was to evoke a flow of unmistakable experience. \r\nBreer first heard of the Osaka Pavilion Project from one of his neighbors, David Thomas, who was Vice-President of Pepsi-Cola International in charge of marketing and distribution. Thomas had been asked to handle the project after it had already been initiated in Japan by Alan Pottasch, then President of Pepsi-Cola, Japan. Pepsi had secured the space for a pavilion through a clever business stratagem. The executives in Japan had gathered and given information to the Expo Authorities on how to sell food and drinks at a world's fair, and, as Thomas relates, \"more or less as a quid pro quo, the Japanese fair authorities gave us space for a pavilion.\" \r\nAlan Pottasch then proceeded to contract with the Takenaka Komuten Construction firm in Japan to build a pavilion. A faceted dome was selected for the site, the work of Japanese architect Tadashi Doi, resident architect of the 360-year-old Japanese construction firm. The whole project was somehow to become self-liquidating on the basis that Pepsi might gain the concession for beverages for the entire Expo. The Pavilion was to serve as the headquarters for Pepsi operations in the Kansai area. The public part of the Pavilion was to be nothing more than a shell, a set of bleachers, and a bandstand. Since the real market for Pepsi's product is youth, Pottasch planned a worldwide rock contest, with the winning contestants being flown in free by an international airline. The Pavilion theme was to be \"World Without Boundary.\" There was also to be a half-hour high-quality film, perhaps on sports, to be shown on six screens simultaneously. When New York heard of the scheme, which was already underway independently in Japan, they felt it would interfere with Pottasch's distribution work, and handed the assignment to David Thomas, advising him that he had a budget of $250,000 to make the film. \r\nBut when Thomas became involved, in February, 1968, he questioned the idea of an international rock contest because he could find no one who was interested in it. Also, the Pavilion, he discovered, was acoustically the worst design imaginable for a live rock group because they would not be able to hear themselves playing. He was strongly in favor of doing something \"modern.\" \r\nHe bought a book on underground movies and sent it off to Alan Pottasch in Tokyo. Then he consulted his neighbor, Robert Breer. \r\nBreer, at that point, had no interest whatsoever in becoming involved either with sports films or commercial companies; Japan seemed far away and unrelated to his own work. Nevertheless, they discussed the project. Breer gave Thomas a list of filmers and other people to see. \r\nFor six months Thomas was kept out of the project. During this time, there had been negotiations with Walt Disney, which evaporated when Disney began talking about budgets of several million dollars. Essentially, \"the whole matter went dead until August 1968,\" when the project once again came back to Thomas. Now it was six months later, a loss of time that Thomas argues was crucial, and that contributed to the agonies of the later development. \r\nTime was tight and a decision had to be made by mid-December when the representatives of the company from the Far East would be coming to the New York headquarters to make plans and to set budgets that had to be amortized over the next several years. \r\nThomas was very sympathetic to the new youth movements and their music, but he felt something more was needed. Although he claims he knows nothing about art, he had absorbed a feeling for art and for the Far East from his father who had written a classic work on the art of China and Japan, as well as from his own experience in the East.\r\n\"We would be very smart,\" he argued with himself, \"instead of going the gimmick route, to do something genuinely prestigious; to create a piece of contemporary art, one very much in keeping with an avant-garde group, but one also understandable by the people in Japan.\" Armed with this new art idea, Thomas once again went to see Breer. \r\nBreer had been unreceptive to Thomas out of alarm at getting artistically involved with a large commercial company whose taste he imagined would be very conventional. He was also unenthusiastic because, as he said, \"I could see that a world's fair meant gaudy' displays, and I just had a lot of resistance to that.\" A couple of times in the past, Breer had become involved in commercial filmmaking projects, and each experience had been bitter. \"I couldn't live up to their demands,\" he said with a trace of tension in his voice, \"and each time something broke inside me; what I turned out was always bad.\" When he finally did get involved in the Pepsi project, he was still uneasy. \"Oh, Christ, yes!\" he exclaimed, \"Uneasiness is an understatement.\" \r\nDespite his initial hesitation, Breer began to think for the first---time that there might, after all, be some legitimate connection between his work and Expo '70. As he says, a \"simpleminded bell rang in my head.\" In college, Breer, who had been raised as a Catholic, found himself interested in Zen. He liked the idea that there might be a real reason to do something in Japan. He thought: \"Perhaps it's possible to get a corner of the Pavilion, or a reserved area nearby, for a garden of floats, which the Japanese would associate with the rocks in the Japanese temple gardens, which may appear to move if the viewer assumes the proper state of concentration.\" \r\nExcited by the philosophical implications, Breer now pursued the idea with David Thomas. As the possible scale of the project dawned on him, it grew more exciting. He made rough sketches of a dome (he hadn't yet seen the design of the actual dome), and proposed several arrangements for his floats. In one, the visitors were to go over a moat in which the floats moved about. In another, he thought of suspended tea gardens over a sea of floats. At this stage, the proposals were for works outside the dome, or in a space adjacent to it. Breer conceived of them as a quiet antidote to the rock-and-roll racket he believed would prevail inside. \r\nThomas encouraged his neighbor to think about the Pavilion interior. So Breer went further with the drawings, conceiving of his floats inside, platform size. One would contain a rock-music group and would move about the vast floor. Another float would hold the lighting, playing effects off the inside of the faceted dome. \"But,\" he said, \"I was discarding clich\u00e9s as quickly as they came up.\" \r\nBob Breer had become seriously interested in the Pepsi project, and, with the continuing encouragement of Thomas, he began to conceive of possibilities besides his floats. At that time, the soft drink company was still concentrating on the idea of rock bands and live performances; but the physical environment of the interior and exterior was still wide open. \r\nAt this point Breer reached out to Billy Kluver, President of Experiments in Art and Technology, a new organization formed in 1966 in the aftermath of the first large artist-and-engineer collaboration experiment in New York, 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering. What 9 Evenings began in New York was thus continued \\ outside Osaka, half a world away geographically. Indeed, a number of the artists and engineers who participated in the 9 Evenings have also worked on the Expo Pavilion, including Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi and artist Fujiko Nakaya. \r\nA friend of the artists involved in 9 Evenings, Breer provided production assistance and appeared in several pieces. Before then, Breer had been \"leery\" of the artist-engineer collaboration, although he found the open-ended approach employed by Kluver exciting. \r\nWhen Breer suggested to David Thomas that the Pepsi company bring in EAT. (about which they knew practically nothing) to coordinate the project, it was because he felt that through E.A.T. artists could cope with the commercial establishment without getting broken. EAT. could act as a buffer behind which they could operate more freely and more effectively in their own style. \r\nSaid Breer, \"I couldn't deal with these company people. I couldn't speak their language.\" \r\nRobert Whitman, another artist involved in 9 Evenings who was drawn into the Pepsi project, shares Breer's conviction. \"With EAT.,\" he said, \"artists have for the first time had access to professionals on their own level in other worlds. This is a funny thing. Any artist, whether or not he had anything to do with EAT., has professional status and is suddenly more respectable. It's taken a lot of years of work.\" \r\nDespite this favorable billing, there was a real question at that time as to whether or not E.A.T. should, or could, become involved in the Pepsi Pavilion Project. \r\nIn this atmosphere of doubt, Kluver and Breer talked it over.

        "text": "The project that started the whole Pavilion collaboration going, of course, was Bob Breer's floats. John Ryde, a mechanical and electrical engineer with many years experience, became Breer's engineering collaborator. He was interested in the float project because of the engineering and logistics problems involved where and how it could be done. Breer's earlier floats had been relatively lightweight, designed for indoor use, and run by small motors and flashlight batteries. A different approach was needed. Ryde's solution was to borrow the technology of the golf cart. The floats were made with a heavy steel frame, four heavy-duty storage batteries, a third-horsepower motor, and so on. \"What the float really is,\" John Ryde said, \"is an electric automobile that goes about a foot a minute.\" The visitor will have to look very closely, probably down at the skirt of the float, to get the immediate sensation of its movement. Breer and Ryde experimented with different speeds, finding that some went too fast and some too slow, before they arrived at the just detectable speed for the size and mass of their floats. In order to silence the motor, Ryde had the armature rewound to reduce motor speed to about 300 rpm. \r\nBreer and Ryde had to foresee the problems that could occur in anticipation of the trouble that seven, free-moving, eight hundred pound objects could get into. \"We had to consider all surfaces of the Pavilion environment as possible targets for the floats. They touched everything within range-including intrepid Japanese children who got in between three floats to see what would happen,\" Breer related. Several safety systems were installed, and Ryde observed that ultimately if all systems failed, the wheels would slip enough to keep the traction power down. \r\nBreer debated whether there should be sound in his floats, and tentatively suggested that sounds from the Pavilion be transmitted to the floats. This idea was dropped when Larry Owens reported that broadcast transmission was not permitted on the Expo site. Then Breer decided to install identical twenty-minute loop tapes of sound in each float: sawing, Mack truck driving away, three people discussing a beautiful view, a dawn chorus. To compose the tapes, he surrounded himself with tape recorders and played all the tapes out of sync to approximate the effect to be created by the floats as they moved about the terrace, coming together and moving apart.

A quick test carried out at Toshiba Electric Co. showed this was a good solution. Frosty Myers began working with Larry Silverstein of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute who travelled to Japan and researched various lighting systems. The system was finally realized by Boris Sojka in California, a lighting and optics engineer who works for Pichel Industries. The company makes special high-intensity light sources and had perfected a process for making a parabolic mirror reflector for such lights. When Myers first saw these lights, the issue was nearly settled. Said Sojka, \"We spoke the same language, we both understood the direction we were going in, and we just worked out.\" ",

        "text": "Kluver called for a general meeting at the E.A.T. loft on November 10, and he made a point of asking Rauschenberg to be there. \r\nThe meeting proved, as Kluver expected, to be an important turning point. Rauschenberg suggested that since most of them were plastic artists-painters and sculptors-they should shift their approach to include elements that appealed to all the senses rather than just the visual, that is, elements that would create what people would feel as an \"invisible\" environment. Everyone had ideas, and long lists of these were drawn up on the spot. \r\nThe basic idea of the \"invisible environment\" had taken hold, and at the end of the meeting Kluver said, \"OK, you guys have two weeks to come up with a design or there won't be a pavilion.\" The artists decided they would meet alone. \r\nTwo days later, Whitman, Myers, Breer, and Pearce held their first intensive design session. At Whitman's house, they worked and created paper models on Whitman's mirror-top table. Within two weeks the basic design was realized, which remained essentially unchanged throughout the project. \r\nIn thrashing out their ideas, the artists became increasingly committed to true, non-competitive collaboration, discarding ideas, triggering new ideas in each other, and acting as catalysts for each other. In his original plan, for instance, Frosty Myers had a square grid of radio loops on a flat floor (the sound loops consciously borrowed from the dancer Steve Paxton who had used them in 9 Evenings). Onto this elaborate square, the group proposed rear-screen projections so that a visitor could walk out over clouds, over fire, over living creatures like magnified newts and fish. Eventually, however, all types of visual projections were abandoned by mutual agreement, because visitors in most fair situations are battered by projections and from their experience, Breer and Whitman decided it was not a strong enough thing to sacrifice the amount of time and money to research and develop it against other things they wanted to do. \"Then,\" said Myers, \"Bob Whitman came up with the idea of pitching the floor so that the whole floor was related to the optics of the dome.\" \r\nGradually, as Myers suggested, the floor kept getting scaled down. At first the floor was made to vibrate, to hum, to change color, but then it moved toward a more passive and subtle form, each section having a different texture, each texture being related to different sounds over the radio loops. Different smells were also considered, and abandoned. It was remembered that Mike Todd's son had spent several million dollars for movie \"smellies\" and hadn't solved the technical problems. Said Myers, \"It just ends up being a garbage can.\" \r\n\"When we really hit on something we knew would work,\" Frosty reflected, \"it got very exciting. Like we all knew, that was it-especially when one of us injected an idea that was good to start with, and then watched the other two help improve the thing, transform it, tune it up into something. Without their help, you could never have gotten to that point. That was really good! Also, some of the ideas were delegated. For instance, some of our ideas were taken over by one of us to specialize in. Other ideas were given to other artists who got involved later on.\"",

One was for the four towers with lights, the tallest being a hundred feet, and the others grading down at fifteen-foot levels-eighty-five feet, seventy feet, and fifty-five feet-so that the lights set at right angles formed a tilted square. This frame of light was to surround the Pavilion and shine through the Fog; from a distance, a visitor would see a skewed rectangle, and as he approached he would see it as a square framing the Pavilion. As he walked under it \"he would feel he had entered something, sort of a fourth-dimensional fence or gate.\" Myers' other idea was for the Suntrak sculpture, which was to track the sun continually and throw a reflection of it into the Fog during the day. \r\nWhen the Fog was proposed, Pearce realized it made sense because it would be seen from across the fair grounds. If the Pavilion had been crowded down among many of the others, the Fog \"would have been meaningless.\" Likewise, he saw the light frame, forming a slanted square of light framing the outside of the Pavilion, as a special kind of sculptural announcement.

        "text": "Another electronic composer at the Pavilion took a strikingly different direction, although also under David Tudor's lead. One of Tudor's early ideas was to have a shower of laser light whose output would be modified by sounds-creating \"visual sound.\" The sound-modulated laser shower was at first to be in the dome, but when it became evident that its effects would be washed out by the ambient light, the laser was moved to the underground Clam Room. Tudor suggested Lowell Cross to design the laser system. Cross had collaborated with Tudor for some time in making images from sound material using color television sets. Tudor and Cross had then worked on finding the means of making the projection of such television displays large enough for concert audiences. \r\nWhen Cross heard from Tudor that there was interest in having a laser in the Pavilion, and a krypton laser became available through the Coherent Radiation Laboratories, he began to pursue this idea for achieving specific visual effects using vibrating mirrors. With the krypton laser, one can get a four-color output. By designing four sets of mirrors to deflect each of these beams, and by causing sound signals to vibrate these mirror systems, it became possible to get a four-color, visual, live output for the sounds fed into the system. \r\nCross related his concern with translating sound into vision, \"I decided that one of the great problems with electronic music is that it has very little visual information of any real interest. In contrast, a traditional concert is a very social visual experience. There is all the ritual of the conductor in white tie and tails coming out, and everyone in the audience knows what it looks like when sound is produced on almost any kind of musical instrument. Through this experience, a listener to a phonograph recording at home knows what is happening visually as he listens.\" There is no equally rich equivalent for the sounds produced electronically by deadlooking boxes of equipment. So Cross decided it was worthwhile, through electronics, to make a correlation between what one hears and what one sees. \r\nDr. Carson Jeffries became Cross's collaborator on the sound-to-visual transformation. An experimental physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, Jeffries is also a superb mechanical designer as well as a sculptor. It was Jeffries who built the micrometer control system on the light-beam galvanometers that deflect laser beams. \r\nOf their collaboration, Carson Jeffries said: \"I believe this is a collaboration not between a physicist and a musician, but between two artists-Lowell's background in electronics is very good and my background in sculpture is good, so we are working together as artists.\" \r\nAsked what he thinks makes a successful collaboration, Cross answered: \"I just think it takes the ability to get things finished. A real effort and drive on the part of the collaborators to see a thing through to the end and make it work. David Tudor, Carson Jeffries, and I were all highly motivated in this.\" ",

It was a 90 foot diameter 210-degree spherical mirror made of aluminized mylar in which the real image of the floor and the visitors on it hung upside down in space over the their heads. \r\n[...] The spherical mirror in the Pepsi Pavilion, showing the real image of the floor and the visitors hanging upside down in space over their heads. This optical effect resembles that of a hologram. Because of the size of our mirror, a spectator looking at the real image of a person could walk around that image and see it from ail sides. The effect was spectacular.\r\nOur architect John Pearce devised an ingenious way the mylar mirror could be held up inside an air-tight spherical cage. A slight vacuum of less than 1/1000 of an atmosphere in the space between the cage and the mirror was sufficient to hold up the mirror. There was no need for cumbersome air locks.\r\n[...]\r\nThis photograph of Ritty Burchfield with a flag is the first formal photograph taken in the mirror and was used for publicity in Japan. Remy Charlip used this flag and other large pieces of colored cloth for a performance in the Mirror on opening day of the Pavilion. The space in the mirror was gentle and poetic, rich and always changing. It was quite complex in spite of its simplicity. Every day we discovered new and complicated optical effects.\r\n\r\n39. This photograph is printed upside down to demonstrate the real image effect in the mirror. We can clearly see the real image of the backs of two men (one wearing a white hat); and the fronts of the same two men standing on the floor, their arms raised, pointing toward their images. Visitors became very excited when they recognized themselves and their friends in the mirror.\r\n",

Tudor was responsible for the conception of the interior of the dome as a sound environment that would surround and move around the visitors.

        "text": "In talking with the artists, it becomes obvious that each in his own way was struggling to wrap his own conceptions around what was already given, or supposedly given. Following this process, we get insights into how these artists thought of themselves and of their functions. For instance, Tudor was probably most influenced in his thinking and feeling by the presence of the rock groups. When he first heard from Breer about the project, Tudor decided simply \"Not to say 'no,' but to keep it open.\" Tudor understood the situation was to create an environment for rock groups, that is, for live performances. This idea came through to him with \"great force.\" \"My immediate reaction,\" Tudor related, \"was that I wasn't interested as a composer, but that I could serve by thinking of myself more like a performer. I tried to imagine what I would consider an interesting environment if I were a rock performer.\" \r\n \r\nAs soon as he realized the space was to be a dome, Tudor related, he became \"involved\" with the idea of moving sound, especially for rock groups. \"One thing about rock groups,\" he explained, \"is that they all have the same density of sound, and I felt there ought to be some means of creating an unpredictable space relationship that would vary the source of the sound. That is, the rock group wouldn't be able at first to figure out how they are actuating such movement.\" \r\nHis first plan was to spot the sound so that it would not come from all points at once, and to make a program that would interface between a performer and the feedback of his sound, so that the controllable modification would introduce new relationships between the performer and his experience of his work. \r\nThe dome space as given was too small to allow the possibilities of sound differentiation that would be available in a larger space. From this point of view, the rock groups made no sense. The other artists, too, for their own reasons, were struggling around them. They were all tired of rock, and began to toy with the idea of submitting a completely fresh proposal. \"Somehow,\" Tudor remembered, \"we never made that decision, it arose naturally. As we defined more and more details of the interior, it became its own space, with its own characteristics, and finally it became clear that rock groups were inappropriate.\" \r\nIn defining \"differentiation of sound space,\" David Tudor described the fundamental concept behind the sound system of the Pavilion. \"You see, for me,\" he said, \"sound space is more physical; I can almost touch it.\" \"I kept the sound movement,\" he said, \"because the idea was still in my head; I thought it would be intriguing to experience sound that moved very quickly. The sound moving from speaker to speaker moves so quickly that it destroys the shape of the sound wave. There will be a point at which the speed is so great that the original sound will be destroyed. My interest is in going beyond that point and seeing what speed itself will create; to see what kinds of sound material will not require faithful reproduction or will act as a new sound generator. We've never heard that.\" \r\n",

        "text": "The sound-modifier system was proposed by composer David Tudor. When the time came to think about equipment for the sound system, Tudor brought Gordon Mumma into the project. Mumma suggested a system that would modify the pitch (frequency), the loudness, and the color (formants) of each of the eight channels of the sound system, so as to give the \"player\" a more flexible instrument. \r\nMumma, originally a French-horn player and a pianist, said that although he still plays conventional instruments, his primary interest for the past decade has been in electronic music. In effect, he now builds his own instruments, seeing little difference between this development and the time when musical instruments were developed through mechanical means. \"It's just that the technology today is electronics rather than mechanics.\" \r\nAt the outset of his involvement with the Pavilion sound system, Mumma made what is essentially a philosophical decision about the direction he would take. He said, \"I didn't want to generate sound, or make sound; I didn't want to make a toy instrument. Instead, I wanted to make an environmental control system for sound.\" \r\nJust about the time Mumma started to implement ideas for the system, he came across a new small solid-state circuit (called a \"gate-controlled amplifier\") of a special kind. \"I had,\" he said, \"an idea that it could be used for some things the manufacturer hadn't really thought of, and in the course of about four weeks, I filled a notebook with various things I was able to do with it. All of them, interestingly, fit the possibilities I had in mind for the sound-modifier console. This single integrated circuit not only generated more efficient ways of working, but new ideas as well\" \r\nMumma's final system was ready by late February, 1970. It then had to be interfaced with the system designed by Tudor-and the engineer, Larry Owens. \r\nThe interfacing of these system parts required the closest degree of collaboration between Mumma and Owens. Said Mumma: \"I had to be able to take the sound signals they were producing, and had to give them signals they could use after the sound-modifier processing. We collaborated in the greatest of detail. Otherwise, I was able to carry forward my work on the modifier autonomously.\" \r\nBecause there are eight channels of sound that can undergo modification, and twelve controls for each channel, Mumma's control console contains a total of ninety-six controls in all. This, he notes, is the same order of magnitude of combinations as one has with a large organ. Although ninety-six controls may seem like a large number to cope with, Mumma feels that a person with practice can, in an hour or so, get a good idea of possible configurations and then be able to treat it as a performing instrument.

        "text": "Toward the Sound System \r\n\r\nAs engineering consultant in the early conceptualizing meetings on the project, Waldhauer listened to David Tudor's ideas and identified the character of the engineering problems in order to identify the technical problems involved. During the first trip to Japan, Tudor described sounds that would move around and over the top of the dome, so that the listener would have the impression that the sound was somehow embodied in a vehicle that was flying around him at varying speeds, from so slow that the motion would be just barely noticeable, to so fast that again the ear would not be able to detect motion. Waldhauer's first suggestion was to space loudspeakers in a grid around the dome and to interconnect them in such a way that a given sound could be commutated between the loudspeakers using a joystick or handle that could be moved around by the performer. Apparent movement of the sound source would correspond to the position or movement of the joystick. This idea would have been workable except that Tudor asked for twenty sound channels, all capable of moving independently around the dome. Waldhauer felt that a twenty-joystick system was beyond the capability of even a shoeless performer, so that some sort of programming or automation would be needed. \r\nThere the matter rested for two months until March 10, when Waldhauer invited Larry Owens to a meeting with Tudor, and John Pan. Owens is a member of the technical staff with the Digital Techniques Department at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey where he works on special-purpose digital machines and on signal processing. He had also participated in a few collaborative projects with artists that involved the electronic switching of sounds in an audio system, and, therefore, seemed to be well suited to solve the technical problems that Tudor's sound system presented. The engineers saw the problem of moving the sounds as David wanted as essentially a switching problem and John Pan proposed a system similar to TASI, a switching system used to increase the efficiency of transatlantic submarine cable telephone transmission. The TASI system switches many trunks or telephone line inputs at each end of a cable onto a smaller number of transmission channels of a cable by filling up empty spaces. Voice-actuated switches at each end switch a trunk away from a channel when a trunk user is momentarily silent. This kind of system would switch the many different sound inputs through the originally proposed twenty channels onto sixty speakers. Instead of voice actuation the switching was to be controlled by a programming system that Pan and Owens proposed at this meeting. \r\nChoices made early in the development of the digital switching system (in particular the punch-paper tape programmer) made it impossible to handle the number of channels Tudor wanted. Owens traded off the number of channels for the physical realizability of his system. The channels were reduced from twenty to sixteen, and finally to eight. At this point, the reduction of channels removed the original objections to analogue control by joysticks, but the design of the system using digital control was too far advanced to introduce this change. \r\nLarry Owens agreed to design the schematics, components, and layouts for the audio system. The design was to be on paper with Owens building nothing. \r\n\r\nIn April, Kluver asked Owens to be part of the group of engineers who were going to Japan to meet with the Takenaka people on technical aspects of the Pavilion. \r\nThey went, Owens recalled, with the idea of transferring the actual development of the systems to their Japanese colleagues. \r\nThe American artists and engineers overestimated the degree to which the Japanese would be willing to collaborate on designing and building components. From the first meeting at the offices of the Takenaka Komuten, in Osaka, the Japanese wanted finished drawings, schematics, equipment specifications, and wiring diagrams. \r\nBy their last day of meetings, Kluver asked Owens to be the engineering coordinator for the many separate projects. There were hundreds of practical questions to be dealt with: who was to be responsible for each piece of equipment; what it was to look like; who was to make the specifications; who was to decide which cost estimates were reasonable; what kind of gear could be brought over from the United States and what was its compatibility with equipment made in Japan; and how would they tie together or interface the various systems? The final system had to be integrated into a single controllable package. \r\nUntil then, John Pearce, the coordinating architect, had been acting as project manager, but now, Owens and Pearce together made the day-to-day architectural and technical decisions, balancing out the needs among all the collaborators-artists, engineers, architects, the Pepsi people, and the Japanese. Owens and Pearce complemented each other's strengths and together they made an effective team. \r\n\r\nAlthough Tudor and Waldhauer had decided in the first meeting in Tokyo that the amplifiers, loudspeakers, the tape recorders-the things you can buy off the shelf-would be bought and installed in Japan, it was now determined by the group that the console had to be built in the United States, since there was too little time to transfer design information to the Japanese. \r\nIn normal engineering programs for equipment manufacture, the usual procedure is to make preliminary designs, test them on rough models to determine design feasibility, then build a prototype or first real model, and test it extensively to eliminate design flaws (usually called \"debugging\"). But Owens decided that he would not have time to build a prototype, but would have to go from designs on paper directly to the final model. \r\nWhen Owens returned to the United States in April, 1969, from the first of his many trips, he began the detailed design of the control console for the sound and light systems. He asked two technicians, Per Biorn (who had collaborated on 9 Evenings) and Peter Kubik, to implement his designs. Later on, Skip Savard and Lowell Van't Slot, who designed a crowd-counting system, were added to the team. \r\nThe audio control system was to be completed by early January, 1970, and coordinated with the sound-modifier system being developed separately by Gordon Mumma. As things went, the system was not ready for debugging until the control console was installed in the Pavilion in late February. The debugging process was never to be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the case of the Fog illustrates successful collaboration, the history of the sound system points up the problems. Calvin Tomkins' section describes some of the things that went awry in the final days and hours before the Pavilion opened on March 15, 1970, but the basic problems developed much earlier. \r\nAlthough a complete analysis of the interactions and decisions that led to difficulties in the evolution of the sound system is not possible here, it is worthwhile comparing some of the judgments of the leading participants. \r\nFred Waldhauer has commented that this form of collaboration is a very fragile process. \"But,\" he said, \"there are two roads to go: find engineers who are willing to change, to take risks and to take the responsibility for the implications of collaboration with an artist, or institute hierarchy. We have always chosen to do the former. There is no question that Larry did a mammoth job for so young a man, but in the case of the sound system he was not able to sacrifice some of his engineering baggage to make his collaboration on the sound system go.\" \r\nOwens talked about the pressures of the collaboration on him. He found, of course, that it was a real learning process, because \"the artist\" he said is a person who \"doesn't really want to make up his mind six or eight months in advance, and, yet, in a project of this magnitude, the technology demands such decisions in order \"to meet schedules.\" Owens went on, \"occasionally, we've made unilateral decisions. The environmental concept as originally envisioned has altered, partly due to engineering decisions. The artist is much more vague than the engineer, so you are not making decisions based on facts. Sometimes you are making decisions based on the absence of facts! What the engineer does in this case is to invent facts, make a decision, implement the decision, and then come back to the artist and say 'Is this what you meant?' \" One of the problems, he feels, is that the artist does not know what engineering is, and then furthermore, \"The artist doesn't visualize things in terms of words. The artist deals with things.\" \r\nDavid Tudor felt that Owens' attitude that the artist cannot participate in the engineering, precluded artistic alternatives in a situation with pressing deadlines. \"At the beginning, one lays down the things one wants to work with,\" Tudor said, \"then the engineering becomes an interpretation of this. If you then can't go inside the engineering problems and are never allowed to offer an alternative along the engineering road, the thing takes the engineer's shape. It was a one-way street, and my original ideas were leaving one by one. Of course there were strict time considerations and delays and delays, but Larry wanted, above all, to present me with a finished product, and warded off all 'meddling.' \r\n\"The number of channels cost me more heartache than anything else,\" Tudor continued, \"My conception of numbers was real. Like with a juggler, three balls are different from four balls, and the difference is so extreme it goes all the way down the line. In January, 1969, I asked for twenty channels, in the system I was presented with it finally stopped being reduced at eight. Numbers were different in Larry's thinking and there was no translation possible.\" \r\n",

        "text": "Robert Whitman asked artist Tony Martin to design the interior light system. Martin's approach was to design lighting to \"render perceivable the basic visual dynamics of the real and virtual images,\" and to explore the \"permutations of the combined reflections as a changeable and natural, though unusual, space for people to enjoy and do things in.\" He travelled to the site in Japan and consulted with Boris Sojka and Elsa Garmire on the West Coast. In addition to a series of fixed and moving spotlights in the top of the dome, he devised a central interior light that illuminated upward and moved vertically through the focal point of the Mirror to the top of the Mirror dome. He described the effect this light produced: \"Light from this source will reflect downward from the dome and illuminate a circular to donut shape in variable diameters on the peopled floor. For general real-imaging of floor activity it will create a convex image in midspace of the area which is illuminated.\" \r\nAlthough he saw color as a \"natural result of reflected clothing and floor elements and activity,\" he added gel combines to the movable spotlights. All the light functions-intensity, movement, color -were programmable. Martin wanted to make it possible for a performer to combine \"spontaneous action and tuning of the dome's visual events with the packaged programming of them using audio tape (multichannel, on/off, intensity, and time control as well as straight audio-signal intensity control) and/or papertape digital control of these functions.\" ",

        "text": "Kluver called for a general meeting at the E.A.T. loft on November 10, and he made a point of asking Rauschenberg to be there. \r\nThe meeting proved, as Kluver expected, to be an important turning point. Rauschenberg suggested that since most of them were plastic artists-painters and sculptors-they should shift their approach to include elements that appealed to all the senses rather than just the visual, that is, elements that would create what people would feel as an \"invisible\" environment. Everyone had ideas, and long lists of these were drawn up on the spot. \r\nThe basic idea of the \"invisible environment\" had taken hold, and at the end of the meeting Kluver said, \"OK, you guys have two weeks to come up with a design or there won't be a pavilion.\" The artists decided they would meet alone. \r\nTwo days later, Whitman, Myers, Breer, and Pearce held their first intensive design session. At Whitman's house, they worked and created paper models on Whitman's mirror-top table. Within two weeks the basic design was realized, which remained essentially unchanged throughout the project. \r\nIn thrashing out their ideas, the artists became increasingly committed to true, non-competitive collaboration, discarding ideas, triggering new ideas in each other, and acting as catalysts for each other. In his original plan, for instance, Frosty Myers had a square grid of radio loops on a flat floor (the sound loops consciously borrowed from the dancer Steve Paxton who had used them in 9 Evenings). Onto this elaborate square, the group proposed rear-screen projections so that a visitor could walk out over clouds, over fire, over living creatures like magnified newts and fish. Eventually, however, all types of visual projections were abandoned by mutual agreement, because visitors in most fair situations are battered by projections and from their experience, Breer and Whitman decided it was not a strong enough thing to sacrifice the amount of time and money to research and develop it against other things they wanted to do. \"Then,\" said Myers, \"Bob Whitman came up with the idea of pitching the floor so that the whole floor was related to the optics of the dome.\" \r\nGradually, as Myers suggested, the floor kept getting scaled down. At first the floor was made to vibrate, to hum, to change color, but then it moved toward a more passive and subtle form, each section having a different texture, each texture being related to different sounds over the radio loops. Different smells were also considered, and abandoned. It was remembered that Mike Todd's son had spent several million dollars for movie \"smellies\" and hadn't solved the technical problems. Said Myers, \"It just ends up being a garbage can.\" \r\n\"When we really hit on something we knew would work,\" Frosty reflected, \"it got very exciting. Like we all knew, that was it-especially when one of us injected an idea that was good to start with, and then watched the other two help improve the thing, transform it, tune it up into something. Without their help, you could never have gotten to that point. That was really good! Also, some of the ideas were delegated. For instance, some of our ideas were taken over by one of us to specialize in. Other ideas were given to other artists who got involved later on.\"",

Transition from one section to the next will be instantaneous and dramatic.\r\n\r\nA poet will write a description, both artistic and technical, about what is taking place. This will be heard over the loop system, e.g. \"It is now Spring ... streams full from melting snows ...\" The sound of water gurgling and rushing will come over the sound system. To create the impression of actual passage of water, different speakers will transmit different water sounds.\r\nTechnical information on how this is done will be given over the loop-system.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM OUTLINE\r\n\r\n1.

Re-enact clas[s]ical Japanese legends and dramas in dome environment.\r\n2. Use sound system to program traditional and contemporary Japanese poetry: use lights and other sounds in addition to reading poems to create moods of haiku poetry.\r\n3. Use sound and light system of the Pavilion to create patterns anal[o]gous to and derived from Fibonacci \"spiral\" sequences of sunflowers and sunburst motion of cathode ray tube.\r\n4. Activity oriented use of dancers, tumblers, and circus performers.\r\n5. Environment can be made gentle and lyrical, associated with nature sounds and environments\u2014in a forest, under the sea\u2014 or it can be made violent and turbulent\u2014 thunderstorms, earthquakes, volcanos erupting.\r\n6. Use a large flexible mirror surface on the floor, photo cells, and reflect light through the focal point to make the pavilion a light machine activated by the visitors.\r\n7. Visitors rearrange shapes made of plastic or cloth, moving them to different positions on the floor.\r\n8. Spectator games using handsets, light beams, sonar devices, echo-location devices, and sound and light reflective shields.\r\n9. With telephone lines hooked to each of the thirty-seven speakers visitors to Expo can pick up a phone and call the pavilion within certain hours to recite their favorite poem or sing a song.\r\n10. Floor loops can be used to broadcast news from all over the world in different languages\r\n11. Taking of photographs in the pavilion\r\n12. Using movement of sound on speakers to simulate whales swimming closer and closer singing to each other. By moving sound rapidly to top of dome, the leap of a humpback whale will be created. Use of lights, dimming movement, will simulate descent into the sea. Telephone calls will be heard from people interested in whales.\r\n13. Large over-sized puppets will be held up by helium ballo[o]ns or long sticks inside in form of large people, large hand, full-scale whale, etc.\r\n14. Group costumes many people wear special costu[me] simultaneously (for school groups especially) red circle, rainbow, concentric circle, weaving pattern, sea or cate[r]pillar, dragon or hill.\r\n15. Pick up words and phrases of visitors and keeping them intelligible, switch them from speaker to speaker.\r\n16. Using fibre-optics and handsets to create planetarium and floating solar system.\r\n17. Performers wearing special costumes and carrying mirrored shields will reflect sound and light.\r\n18. Articulate characteristic frequencies of the dome by recirculating sounds of speech through several cycles of being played and re-recorded in the dome, so that bell-like tones remain.\r\n19. Large round 'keyboard' in the center of the floor that visitors step on to activate dome functions.\r\n20. Demonstration for school children of physical properties of dome and sound in spherical shape using the loop system.\r\n21. A sine-wave generator will be used to make standing wave forms in the dome. The sound will vary in volume throughout the space, and visitors will hear according to their position on the floor. The resonant frequencies of the dome will be used.\r\n22. Light-weight aluminum mobiles will be hung on which lights of the pavilion will play.\r\n23. Programs incorporating such events as flashes from xenon lights, simulated sunrise with seagulls, rocket ship take-off with rising winch light, watery and biological sounds, a thunderstorm, streamers, wind machine, flames, lights on poles, flashbulbs.\r\n24. A low-power laser beam direct vertically up a descending stream of water from a siphon under the winch.\r\n25. Use of tape delay system to produce multiple echoes.\r\n26. A neon show: neon figures and shapes that move inside the mirror; vertical neon light from top to focal point; horizontal rotating light.\r\n27. Rate of movement of sound and light will vary and correspond to the density of the visitors in the dome.\r\n\r\nNote: These ideas have been copyrighted by the artists and are the property of the artists.",

        "text": "Live Programming for the Pepsi Pavilion: Request for Proposals\r\nOctober 15, 1969\r\n\r\n1. Programmers\r\n\r\n\tTwenty-tour programmers will be chosen, half from Japan and half from the United States and Europe. Each programmer will stay for a period of three, four, or five weeks at the Pavilion. At any given time during the twenty-six weeks of Expo, at least four programmers will be in residence to program the Pavilion. The residencies of the programmers will be staggered by one week to smooth over the break in the schedule when a new programmer takes over (Figure 1). The programming will change every week due to the addition of a new programmer. The four programmers will decide, in collaboration, on the total program for the weeks that they work together. The collaborative nature of the programming means that adjustments may take place in the submitted proposals in accordance with the opinions of the programmers working together.\r\n\tEach programmer will be asked to introduce and inform the new programmer who will succeed him. Each programmer will also be asked to coordinate the programming for one week. This will be the last or the next-to-last week of his stay. When he receives notice of the acceptance of his proposal, each programmer will be told who his three collaborating programmers will be during the week when he is coordinator. He should contact them as far in\r\nadvance of his coordination week as possible. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n2. General Nature of Programming\r\n\r\n\tWe want the visitors to be responsible for their own experiences-to have choices. The Pavilion and the programming will provide for this.\r\n\tWe feel that the program for one day should be a homogeneous continuum. Changes should be introduced gradually and radical, overall changes occur only after a considerably longer period than the average visiting time, The homogeneous nature of the programming will allow any visitor to come in at any time in the cycle without feeling that he is interrupting something that has a beginning and an end (Figure 2). The stay of the average visitor cannot be very long, but we should like some people to be able to stay longer if they feel like it. A reasonable assumption is that 1,500 people will walk through the Pavilion every hour. A visit will\r\nprobably range from ten to thirty minutes.\r\n\tTo aid the programmers, a graph in the control room will plot the number of people in the Pavilion at any given time. A given section of the programming may be shortened or lengthened by manual controls. This will add flexibility in affecting the length of stay of the visitors.\r\n\tThe two major programmable elements, the spherical Mirror and the overall sound system, discussed below, and the floor segments with their sound-loop system can all be activated together, or one or the other emphasized at any one time (Figure 3).\r\n\tDue to the slope of the floor, visitors will obscure each other's direct view of anything taking place at floor level. Performances or activities on the floor cannot be seen directly by the majority of the visitors. Any performances or activities will be reflected in the mirror and in this way be seen by the visitor as a reflection, as real or virtual images.\r\n\tObjects and people can be placed in space above the heads of the spectators either supported by scaffolding or other support structures from the floor, or through bouncing off mats - e.g. tumblers.\r\nWeights of up to 44 pounds can be hung from the ceiling if they do not swing. No people can be suspended from the ceiling.\r\n\r\n3. Important considerations\r\n\r\n\tIt will be the responsibility of the Programmers to develop a program which will get people to leave the Pavilion. In order to make all proposals comparable, they must assume a 15-minute visiting time.\r\n\r\n4. The Sound System\r\n\r\n\tThe thirty-seven speakers comprising the output channels for the sound system, are placed on a rhombic grid in the dome behind the mirror. (Figure 4) There are three categories of extremes of sound reproduction:\r\na) The line sound; a sound is switched at a rapid rate from speaker to speaker in any desired pattern. Switching time from speaker to speaker is approximately one-tenth of a second. The amount of time a sound stays on any one speaker is programmable.\r\nb) Point sound; a sound is heard from one speaker in the dome. Point sound can be shifted to any other speaker in the dome.\r\nc) Immersion, or environmental, sound; this effect is much like standing in a wood, or on a street, where sounds come from all directions. This will require multiple recordings of sounds.\r\n\r\n\tThe sound system has 8 input channels fed by tape recorders, microphones and telephone lines. Any one of the 8 input channels can be switched to any one of - or any combination of - the output channels. Each input channel can be programmed to pass through stages of sound modification: AM, FM, PM, envelope shaping etc. (Figure 5)\r\n\tThe programming is done on hard-wired programming cards. A large number of these cards will be available with standard switching patterns. However, it will be possible for each Programmer to make up his own cards at the Pavilion.\r\n\tTapes are now being collected of non-copyrighted sounds : sounds of brain waves, heart beats, earthquakes, the earth, fish,animals; factory and street sounds etc. The sounds are continuously repeated. (See Appendix 1)\r\n\tAnyone who wishes further specific details about the sound system should contact Larry Owens, David Tudor, Toshi Ichyanagi, or Gordon Mumma, through Peter Poole.\r\n\r\n5. Handsets and Loops in the floor\r\n\r\n\tEach visitor is given a handset in the entrance tunnel. The handset has a magnetic pickup, an amplifier and a speaker. Audio-fed loops under the various floor sections transmit sounds to the handset. A list of typical sounds is attached. These sounds can be programmed from the Control Room.\r\n\tAt the opposite end of the handset, a lightbulb is turned on by a sixty cycle-per-second signal through the loops. The light can only be turned on for a total of three minutes in every fifteen- minute period. The audio can be on for any length of time. After each fifteen-minute period, the batteries have to be recharged. (Figure 6)\r\n\r\n6. Light System\r\n\r\nBasically there are four areas of visual possibilities in the Dome:\r\n\r\na) Lighting individual groups of people and things, with programmable intensity, color and duration, so that they produce images in the mirror-whether real images in space, or virtual images appearing behind the reflective surface.\r\nb) Lighting larger areas, and especially peripheral areas in the Dome, with preset spots programmed for sequence, duration etc. \r\nc) Throwing beams from two high intensity sources on the equator level, through space, bouncing lines of light around the dome, illuminating small areas, things, people etc.\r\nd) Activating the mirror with an interior 3 kilowatt source which is moveable vertically through the focal point, the center of the hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\tThese four areas can be used separately, or combined by the programmer who can manipulate all the functions of the light apparatus on the Control Console.\r\n\r\n\tThere are three holes at the seven-metre-diameter level of the Mirror, where lights are placed. Each hole contains three lights: two one-kilowatt spots with fourteen-inch reflectors. These light areas approximately eight feet in diameter, generally in a concentric plot, i.e. six lit areas around the center. Plus one auto-color, auto- iris, 1-kilowatt spotlight. This spotlight impinges on a plane\r\nmirror approximately one half x one meter large. The mirror is located two and eight-tenths meters from the front of the spotlight and in a housing that can pan and tilt. The limit of the pan movement is 240 degrees. The tilt movement has no limit.\r\n\tThere are two holes located at about ten feet from the floor on opposite sides of the Dome. Through each hole shines the seventy-five-watt pole-mounted Xenon, a high-intensity small diameter, spot beam.\r\n\tAt the center of the dome is a hemispherical housing, which is hanging from a winch, and which contains three one-kilowatt bulbs. The housing can move from one meter off the floor, to two meters from the top of the Dome.\r\n\tAll of the lights are programmable except the two seventy-five-watt xenons, which have on-off control only. The entire system can be controlled from the console and/or from a punched-paper tape machine.\r\n\r\n7. The Mirror\r\n\r\n\tThe optical properties of the Mirror are described in an enclosed article by Elsa Garmire. If you have any questions about various effects to be obtained, you can contact her. It is still possible to see a good approximation of the mirror in Los Angeles, where a full-scale model has been erected for experimentation. Contact Peter Poole.\r\n\r\n8. Style\r\n\r\n\tWe should like the experiences to \"tend towards the real\" rather than the philosophical. We are not interested in political or social comment, instructional performances, statements, etc. We are anxious that professional people - e.g. sports people, snake handlers, fashion people - participate as much as possible. We are interested in participation by the visitors.\r\n\r\n9. Schedules, Expenses, and Deadlines\r\n\r\n\tWe would prefer it if the Resident Programmers remained in Osaka for a month. Three weeks is the acceptable minimum. Programmers will be paid five hundred dollars a week. They are asked to arrive in Osaka three to five days before their programming period is due to begin, so as to become familiar with procedures and equipment. They will not be paid for these days. We would appreciate it if you could give some indication of the times when you will definitely not be able to go to Japan. Travel and accommodation will be provided for Programmers and their wives, but food costs will not be covered.\r\n\tThe following schedule has been set up for selection of programmers:\r\n\tMonday, November 17: No more programming proposals will be accepted after this date. It would help considerably if you would include an estimate of the probable cost of your program, or information on the availability of special materials.\r\n\tMonday, December 22: You will be notified as to whether your proposal has been accepted and given your residence period. You will also be told the names of your collaborating programmers and the nature of their proposals.\r\n\tEveryone who submits a proposal will be advised about the progress and content of the Live Programming.\r\n\tPeter Poole is coordinating the collection of sound tapes and the organization of the programming. He can be reached at: E.A.T., 235 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10003; telephone- 677-3750. Please contact him if you have any questions.

        "text": "LIVE PROGRAMMING IN THE PEPSI PAVILION\r\n\r\nIn the Pepsi Pavilion, we are working together to give each visitor an opportunity to create his own physical, tactile experience in a lively, changing, sensuous environment. The concepts of choice, variety and involvement are carried through in the Live Programming planned for the Pavilion. For the Live Programming, individuals from many different professions will design programs and then come to the Pavilion to implement them. The Resident Programmer will interact with his programming and adjust, expand, and extend his efforts in response to the actual situation he finds at the Pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe Resident programmers will be artists, musicians, poets, composers, engineers, scientists, sportsmen, toy designers, playground equipment designers, architects, fashion designers, industrial designers, advertising people, rock groups, actors, singers. At any one time at the Pavilion, a team of three or four individuals from different areas will work together to program the day's activities. These mixed teams will provide the flexibility to correspond with the different types of audiences that will be visiting the Pavilion at different times of the day. Each Resident Programmer will spend between two and four weeks programming the Pavilion, and the individual schedules will be staggered in order to provide smooth transition between incoming and outgoing programmers.\r\n\r\nThe Resident Programmers have the whole Pavilion and its electronic equipment to work with. The electronic system, while complex and capable of great variety and versatility, is not complicated to program and use. The sound system, which is programmed by hard-wired program cards, has 16 inputs, and the outputs are 43 speakers arranged in a grid system in the mirror dome so that sounds can be moved in any desired pattern and at any desired speed. The sounds-in the hand sets from the Loop System and the lights in the hand sets can be programmed. The character of the fog and the light frame outside are also programmable elements. The spectacular optical properties of the dome \u2014 the three-dimensional images and the other reflections \u2014 can be moved, changed, and activated in space by various light sources. The movement, placement, duration and color of these lights can be programmed using a combination of punch-paper tape, other counting mechanisms, magnetic tape, or manual controls. A Control Console which can be played will be located on the floor of the Pavilion. The programmer can use pre-composed, pre-programmed material, and then combine it with on-the-spot manipulations and operations.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the mirror-dome room can vary from being serene and calm, to a hubbub of activity, with movement of lights, many sounds, and rapidly-sequenced events. The Resident Programmers will determine the character of the space, the length of time of their programs, the movement of visitors, and the rhythm of performances and other events. The Pavilion with its great variety of moods and activities becomes a microcosm of Expo itself.\r\n\r\nA Resident Programmer may want to use only the electronic system, for example:\r\n\ta program created by a sound-effects man from the film industry;\r\n\tcreating entire sports environments such as a football game, car racing, horse racing using sound and lights;\r\n\tprograms by composers or poets.\r\n\r\nSome Programmers may want to include objects or props in their work such as :\r\n\tremote-controlled shapes flying in space;\r\n\tobjects hanging in space;\r\n\tlarge objects emitting light and sound that roll or can be pushed.\r\n\r\nMany of the Programmers will incorporate live performances and activities into their programs. The live performances can be short, take place at varying times, and be repeated several times a day. They will be very open, simple, flexible and mobile. The effect will be much like a traditional marketplace or bazaar where performers appear, activate the environment, and then leave.\r\nSome examples are:\r\n\tCircus-type performances such as lasso and rope tricks, clowns, jugglers, magicians, tight-rope walkers, simple\r\n\tanimal acts ;\r\n\tdance, such as excerpts from classical ballet, mime groups, folk dances ;\r\n\tsports, such as wrestling, ping pong, gymnastics, weight lifting, pole and ladder climbing, fencing, judo, karate;\r\n\tfashion shows, with models circulating on the floor;\r\n\ttraditional Japanese folk dances and sports.\r\n\r\nThe above is a brief description of the possibilities for the daily programming of the Pavilion, which will make it an exciting place where things happen. The dome-shaped structure, mirror and sound system will transform these activities into beautiful phantasmagorical extensions of reality, mixing the real and the reflected in new levels of perception.\r\n\r\nSpecial events will be held in the Pavilion. Television and film personalities, singers, rock groups, traditional Japanese theater and music, and well-known contemporary composers will be invited to perform there. Traditional Japanese performances will celebrate the richness of Japanese culture in which every province has its own art, ceremonies, sports, celebrations and performers. Well-known personalities will be asked to appear in the Pavilion and use the light and sound system to make special programs: an astronaut, Stirling Moss, Joe Namath, The Beatles, Duke Ellington, Allen Ginsberg, Dustin Hoffman, Sidney Poitier, Andy Warhol, and corresponding Japanese personalities.\r\n\r\nDistinguished visitors to the Pavilion will be invited to operate the Control Console and create their own work in the environment. A further possibility for extending the number of people able to participate in the programming of the Pavilion is to have a duplicate Control Console in the United States, so that special programs could originate from this country.\r\n\r\nA Board of Artistic Advisors here and in Japan will suggest appropriate people to be Resident Programmers. These individuals will be contacted and asked to submit proposals and ideas. The Board of Advisors and the core artists will choose which proposals will be used, thereby giving an overall theme, direction and style to the Pavilion. Procedures are being developed, and will be worked out during the coming months.\r\n\r\nThe Pepsi Pavilion developed out of a multi-sided collaboration directly involving many people, and Live Programming is an extension of this collaboration into the software phase of the project. The collaboration is using the new technology to create a lively, responsive human environment based on a belief in the positive relationship between the individual and technology and in the great possibilities for the individual which arise out of the interaction between them. It points the way to a technology of the future which will provide not repetition and uniformity, but choice and variety, with avenues for personal exploration, expression, and participation. The Pepsi Pavilion is an embodiment of the basic idea of Expo 70 in its celebration of the people themselves \u2014 their activities, their achievements and their aspirations.",

        "text": "While the hardware for the project was being designed and built, Kl\u00fcver and Whitman spent a lot of time thinking about what Kl\u00fcver called its software--the events that would take place inside the Pavilion. The original idea of a rock-music discoth\u00e8que had been superseded by the concept of an automated \"environment,\" with sound and lighting and other effects programmed in advance. By the spring of 1969, though, the infinite range of possibilities offered by the sound system, the lights, and the optical marvels of the Mirror led Kl\u00fcver, Whitman, and Tudor to decide that automation would be too limiting. Only if this unique theatrical space was made available to other artists as well, they felt, could that range of possibilities be tapped. Live programming would mean, of course, a substantial increase in the operating budget something in the neighborhood, Kl\u00fcver thought, of a hundred thousand dollars. Pottasch agreed with the new idea in principle, but he did not quite see the need for inviting as many artists as Kl\u00fcver had in mind-at least twelve Americans and an equal number of Japanese, each of whom would spend four weeks at the Pavilion during Expo's six-month run. Why not just get four good artists, Pottasch suggested, and let them come up with a basic program that could then be repeated several times a day? Kl\u00fcver said that nobody could tell who was going to make the best program until he had actually made a program, because nothing like the Mirror dome had ever existed before. The situation was open-ended, and this, as Kl\u00fcver kept trying to tell Pepsi, was what it was all about. The process of artists working in the Pavilion was what interested E.A.T., more than guaranteed results. It was this kind of argument that drove some of the Pepsi executives up the wall.",

        "text": "As usual, E.A.T got Its way. A tentative live-programming budget of a hundred thousand dollars was approved-although no contract was signed. Whitman and Peter Poole, a young British geographer who joined E.A.T. in 1967, began lining up American artists on the basis of proposals submitted for programs fifteen minutes long; Miss Nakaya and Toshi Ichiyanagi, a Japanese composer, did the same for Japanese artists. Proposals involving formal dramatic presentations or performances were discouraged. The New York group wanted to have the Mirror dome used as a generalized theatrical space, in which the spectator himself would participate as much as possible. Some spectators might pass through with hardly a pause; others might stay there for hours. The best programs of all, everyone said, would undoubtedly come toward the end of the fair, by which time all concerned would have passed on what they had learned about the Mirror and the sound and light systems. To Pepsi, it all seemed a long way from traveling troubadours and singing dolls. The Pepsi public-relations department was having a terrible time thinking up a name for the Pavilion. Someone hit on the word \"Sensosphere\" to suggest the kind of total sensory experience visitors would have there; the name stuck for several weeks, until it was discovered that in Japanese \"senso\" means \"war.\"",

        "text": "Vikram Sarabhai, head of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, asked E.A.T. to develop methods for creating instructional programming for television to be used for the ATS-F Satellite which was going to be placed over India. We assembled a group of specialists in engineering, education and television, as well as an artist, Robert Whitman. The group went to India in December 1969 and worked at the Anand Dairy Cooperative in Gujurat State to produce programs for the women who raise buffalo for milk production. We proposed using 1/2\" video equipment to gather material from the villages which would be used as visual research notes when the final instructional programs would be made for broadcast over the satellite. Our proposal, with its emphasis on local input was adopted and became  the  basis for the programming in what is now known as the SITE television satellite project. I consider this project to be E.A.T.'s most significant contribution.",

In 1970 and 1971 we sent nine artists to India for one month each to travel, study, teach or work on their own or on collaborative projects with Indian artists, as they chose. The artists documented their stay through drawings, photographs sound recordings or film. Artists who participated in the project were choreographers Trisha Brown, Steve Paxton, and Yvonne Rainer: composers Lowell Cross, Terry Riley, and LaMonte Young; and visual artists Jared Bark, Jeffrey Lew, Kate Redi[c]ker, and Marian Zazeela. In this photograph, Bark, with his hand on his head, talks with students at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, with whom he worked.",

Visitors were invited to ask people in other countries questions about 1981, ten years into the future. The questions from each site were sent to ail other sites and anyone, expert or layman, could answer the questions about the future.\r\nThis photograph shows the large public environment at the Tokyo telex site organized by Fujiko Nakaya (center), Hakudo Kobayashi (left), and Yuji Morioka (riqht), where people could come and read the telexes from ail over the world and then send their own questions or answers, and have their pictures taken for the project poster, which she printed at the end of the exhibition.",

        "text": "INTERACTIVE DISPLAY SYSTEM FOR THE PLAZA AND FACADE FOR CENTRE BEAUBOURG, PARIS\r\n\r\nSubmitted by:\r\nExperiments in Art and Technology \r\n39 West 53rd Street\r\nNew York, New York 10019 \r\nFebruary 13, 1974\r\n\r\nThe following are three proposals for an Interactive Display System for the Plaza and Facade for Centre Beaubourg.\r\n\r\n1. GAMES \r\nA number of terminals would be placed on the Plaza: terminals would be tables of the size of a normal chess board and placed at such a height that people could stand by them. By activating squares or areas on the boards with a \"stylus\", lights would light up on the facade. These are some of the possible games.\r\n\r\na. Tic-Tac-Toe - A Tic-Tac-Toe matrix would light up on the facade; as the players touch the squares on the terminal surface, crosses or circles appear within the corresponding squares on the facade. Even though Tic-Tac-Toe is a solved game, it still has wide appeal.\r\n\r\nb. Chess - A chess game would be very complex but it might be possible to work out the system for a visual display of a game. In the 8\" x 8\" square display board on the facade, neon symbols would be placed corresponding to \"king\", \"queen\", \"knight\" etc.\r\n\r\nc. Checkers - Played on an 8\" x 8\" square board, it requires only one symbol in each square (an \"X\" or an \"0\"). In addition, the display system would provide for the \"king\" which can move anywhere on the board and each side you have a \"king\".\r\n\r\nd. Ping-Pong - A simulated game of Ping-Pong similar to those now produced on television display systems.\r\n\r\ne. Hobo Chess - Played on an open grid of squares with \"X's\" and \"O's\", where the object is to get five in a row.\r\n\r\nf. Simulated Horse Racing - This would be programmed from the control tower where approximately five horses would move the length of the building. Some form of control of the race could be devised. The betting information would be displayed on the top of the building.\r\n\r\ng. A Maze - Pre-programmed mazes would light up on the facade and the player\r\nwould have a certain amount of time to work through it with a stylus.\r\n\r\nh. Catch The Moving Light - Lights would be programmed to move across the facade. Players would attempt to \"catch\" the light by touching it with a stylus when it is on.\r\n\r\nThe signals triggering the lights would be low-voltage running in ducts to the corresponding areas on the light display board, where a relay in and a simple electronic circuitry would switch on the lights.\r\nThe system should be designed in such a way that games can be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE PLAZA\r\nStep switches on the Plaza would be located underneath, and as people move around on the Plaza, lights would be turned on tracing their path. Again, a low-voltage system would be used to switch on and off the lights. The possibility of overriding certain areas with pre-programmed patterns of \"dance\" performers on the Plaza could be designed.\r\n\r\n3. DRAWING Light sources would be evenly distributed over the facade. The same type of terminals would be used as for the games, except that the terminal boards may have as many as 200 squares. Using a stylus, people would write their names, draw figures, etc. on the facade. This could also include the possibility of programming the display on the facade.",

Fujiko designed a system for making a stage of fog for the dance, the volume and movement of the fog were controlled by turning sets of nozzles off and on to create convection currents. [...]  We built a replica of the Brooklyn stage in my backyard and tested the fog system before moving into the theater. Since the dancers could not dance on a wet marley floor, we rented a large gas-driven heat blower, used in football stadium dugouts, and put it underneath the stage to raise the temperature of the floor so the fog droplets evaporated immediately, keeping the floor dry.",

The material was transferred to video. Swedish filmmaker Barbro Schultz Lundestam is editing the material to present each artists' original work as fully as possible. The videos will also include a documentary section of still photographs, artists' notes, and interviews with artists and engineers. The photograph above was taken from the screen of a television monitor during the editing of \u00d6yvind Fahlstr\u00f6m's work. Kisses Sweeter Than Wine, and shows characters Fahlstr\u00f6m called 'Chinese Sparrows' swinging from long swings attached to the ceiling of the Armory.",

        "text": "The idea of the Fog to shroud the dome was discussed for some time. No one knew whether or not it was actually possible to make a fog, but the idea persisted and survived. Once the fog idea emerged, it immediately suggested two other ideas to Myers, both having to do with the interaction of light and fog. One was for the four towers with lights, the tallest being a hundred feet, and the others grading down at fifteen-foot levels-eighty-five feet, seventy feet, and fifty-five feet-so that the lights set at right angles formed a tilted square. This frame of light was to surround the Pavilion and shine through the Fog; from a distance, a visitor would see a skewed rectangle, and as he approached he would see it as a square framing the Pavilion. As he walked under it \"he would feel he had entered something, sort of a fourth-dimensional fence or gate.\" Myers' other idea was for the Suntrak sculpture, which was to track the sun continually and throw a reflection of it into the Fog during the day. \r\nWhen the Fog was proposed, Pearce realized it made sense because it would be seen from across the fair grounds. If the Pavilion had been crowded down among many of the others, the Fog \"would have been meaningless.\" Likewise, he saw the light frame, forming a slanted square of light framing the outside of the Pavilion, as a special kind of sculptural announcement. Down in the bowl, crowded in, it would have been \"an interesting piece of sculpture, but a waste of money.\"",

        "text": "For his other light sculpture, Myers consulted with Robert Wilson of Bell Laboratories at Holmdel, New Jersey, who had designed a sun-tracking device which operated in the microwave region. For mechanical design and realization of the sculpture, he turned to an East Coast inventor and engineer, Niels Young of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who had won second prize in E.A.T.'s contest the year before for a technological-artistic collaboration. \"Technologically,\" Young declared, \"there is no significant problem involved. It's just a matter of making the structural base strong enough to withstand high winds.\" Myers needed to find a shape for his sculpture that Young could properly design in engineering terms. The two thrashed over many shapes and forms together and argued over the need for one or two mirrors. They spent one whole day making small models until both were satisfied. Although Young had reservations about the seriousness of the sculpture project Myers' enthusiasm, he says, won him over. ",

Pan, Supervisor of Digital Techniques and Systems Studies, Bell Telephone Laboratories, Holmdel, New Jersey; and Nicholas Quennell, Architect, in conjunction with E.A.T. staff, have chosen four areas in which the exhibition, PROJECTS OUTSIDE ART, will concentrate.\r\n\r\n1. A Vegetable Roof Garden to be planted on top of Automation House. This project will be undertaken in collaboration with the Environmental Research Laboratory in Tuscon, Arizona. Peter Poole will be coordinating the Garden project.\r\n\r\n2. A display related to the Garden on the roof demonstrating how plants grow and more precisely, how plants can be made to grow in a city environment. We also plan to translate by electronic means the growth of the plants on the roof as part of the exhibit.\r\n\r\n3. Recreation and Play: this project is still in the planning stage and will be handled by E.A.T./Los Angeles. Ardison Phillips will be coordinator.\r\n\r\n4. Children and Communication is a project which will set up an environment where children will be able to interact with various kinds of communication equipment. Robert Whitman will be coordinator.\r\n\r\nYou are invited to participate in any one of the above projects. If you are interested, please contact us as soon as possible and let us know how much time you would be able to devote and what the nature of your contribution might be.\r\n\r\nWe are planning to publish all the proposals in full or in part submitted for PROJECTS OUTSIDE ART independent of and with no reference to the exhibition. If you wish your proposal to be included, sign the enclosed release form and return it to me.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacquelyn D.

These projects require collaboration among individuals from different professions and institutions.\r\n\r\nThrough our involvement in such projects, we have become increasingly aware of the importance of esthetics in these situations. Many of the important decisions that have to be made are esthetic decisions. Many of the most disruptive and difficult conflicts that arise in these open-ended, multi-disciplinary working situations can be traced to personal or professional esthetic biases. These esthetic commitments are usually hidden, unacknowledged or disguised as something else (economic, political, technical, cultural, psychological, etc.)\r\n\r\nWe would like the symposium to focus on these problems. The purpose of the symposium is to establish the validity of making esthetic decisions within these situations; to articulate the particular esthetic commitments of different professions; and to explore means for arriving at esthetic decisions and resolving esthetic conflicts (procedures, organizational forms, etc.).",

Among the symposium participants suggested or invited were Chester Bowles, John Cage, Noam Chomsky, Kenneth Clark, Richard Feynmann, Harold Howe, Lane Kirkland, Jack Masey, Alva Myrdahl, Ernest Rothkopf, Vikram Sarabhai, Meyer Schapiro, Kenzo Tange, George Wald, Alvin Weinberg, and Jerome Wiesner.\r\n\tPersons interested in these problems and a general, paying audience would be invited to cone. Papers prepared by the participants would be distributed before the symposium to co-participants and people planning to come. Proceedings would be taped, published, and made available for distribution to schools and libraries.\r\n\tThe symposium and conference was variously budgeted from $12,635 to $25,000. The latter included the publication and distribution of proceedings. Funds were requested from the National Science Foundation in January 1970 and the New York State Council on the Arts in July 1970. The funds were not granted and the symposium did not take place.",

The exhibition will be held at Automation House, 49 East 68th Street, New York City. The projects presented in the exhibition will be the result of collaboration among artists, engineers, scientists and other professionals organized into teams.\r\nAnnouncements asking for project proposals were sent to art schools, engineering schools and research laboratories as well as our members. (See attached announcement). On the basis of 116 proposals received, four subject areas were chosen: a roof vegetable greenhouse (to be carried out in collaboration with Environment Research Lab, University of Arizona); visual display of how to create city agriculture; children and communication; recreation and play (to be carried out by E.A.T./L.A.).\r\nIn conjunction with the exhibition we are planning to hold on October 31 an all day symposium, \"Esthetics\". Through our involvement in experimental, collaborative situations, we have become increasingly aware of the significance of esthetics in these situations. Many of the important decisions that have to be made are esthetic decisions. Many of the most disruptive and difficult conflicts that arise in these open-ended, multidisciplinary working situations can be traced to personal or professional esthetic biases. These esthetic commitments are usually hidden, unacknowledged or disguised as something else (economic, political, technical, cultural, psychological, etc.).\r\n\r\n\tThe symposium will focus on these problems.

In addition, there will be a group of invited guests, individuals who are particularly interested in these questions, [page 2] as well as a general audience. We will ask the participants to prepare an article or statement to be distributed before- hand to the co-participants and to the people planning to attend the Symposium. The proceedings of the Symposium will be published.\r\n\r\nWe have received a grant of $25,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts for the exhibition.\r\n\r\nSubmitted to: New York State Council on the Arts\r\nJuly 15, 1970",

As a basis for understanding the project, Robert Whitman, who was personally committed to \"Projects Outside Art,\" saw the essential properties of pure recreation to be accessibility, freedom to participate in a socially approved activity on a personal basis for oneself, and \"some transcendent quality, magic, mystery, fantasy dreams,\"\r\n\tIt seems to me something very interesting could come about if the President of Macy's would announce that Macy's primary business is recreation, not selling things.(2)\r\n\r\n(1) Their project was briefly described in E.A.T.

Los Angeles. Evidently, none had initially submitted individual proposals for \"Projects Outside Art.\"\r\n\tFor the exhibition, now planned to open in May 1971, the group proposed \"Contact Sports: Technology as a Medium for Social Exchange\":\r\n\r\n\tan experimental environment in which the visitor is both creator and object of a series of video and photocopied images. The visitors interact with themselves and not the technology itself. (1)\r\n\r\n\tVisitors would move through three \"video space fields\" identified by specified colors and be able to coordinate their movements by watching television monitors. The images created would be projected on a screen after a three-minute delay. A poster machine would allow visitors to push a button and receive a poster of the same images after a five-minute delay.\r\n\tThe necessary equipment for the project included thirty-eight color video monitors, three color video cameras and projectors, and a color copier. The direct interconnections between the video and print equipment were seen as a demonstration of a marriage between the television and printing industries. Manufacturers in both fields would need to loan some of the equipment which was considered expensive for purchase or rental. The group considered other items basic to set up a permanent video center, at Automation House.\r\n\tE.A.T. in New York found the group's plans too grandiose on the whole and particularly too expensive to be realized for \"Projects Outside Art.\" Aesthetically, the plans also seemed outside the boundary conditions E.A.T. had set up. The project remained unrealized for the exhibition, as did the \"Projects Outside Art\" exhibition itself.\r\n\r\n(1) Proposal submitted by the group to E.A.T, in New York, n.d.",

In the Los Angeles area such a reservoir is the Owens Valley.\r\n\r\nThe orientation necessary for urban dwellers to make the transition from urban to rural activity from the point of view of recreational potential is poorly understood. When the urban dweller goes to rural recreation areas, he often takes with him the habits and attitudes common to his urban lifestyle which are incompatible to the wilderness. Furthermore, when the urban dweller returns to the city, he often fails to see relationships or analogies between the two experiences or ways of life.\r\n\r\nThe development of a transition orientation for the city dweller in Los Angeles so that he can fully experience the recreational effects of the countryside is the goal of this project. The intent of this proposal is to describe the possibilities for informing and orienting an urban population about the utilization of rural recreation.\r\n\r\nContrary to the facility-bound concept of professional recreation wherein adult \"recreators\" supervise the interaction of others, in this project, recreators acting also as investigators, will be roving co-participants, confining themselves to a limited geographic neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Owens Valley, a 20 mile radius of Bishop, California has been selected, and an initial probe will survey the area shown on the accompanying map for its natural benefits, ecological history and recreational potential. A study has already been made of its wind, water and solar conditions (Ralph Knowles, Cultural Heritage Grant). Knowles'study will be helpful, but a complete and intense survey will begin November 6 to compile bibliographic information in the form of charts, maps, graphs, video tapes, booklets, infrared photographs and other appropriate media. The investigation will be divided between Owens Valley and Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThere will be six roving recreator-leaders plus one administrator who will define what information is to be gathered, i.e. visuals, sounds, statistics, questions and answers. In essence these roving recreators will serve as the nucleus of this study. Information gathering will be done in the same manner as a successful experiment conducted in Santa Barbara:\r\n\r\n\tIn the Santa Barbara experience, we went into the community unfamiliar with its people or places. We chose to \"discover\" the recreational potential by befriending three ten-year-old boys. We exchanged tools with them for the day (our tape-recorders for their innertubes) and this immediately made these tools recreactional. We proceeded to explore, guide, and be guided, to follow the natural patterns suggested by those who live there.\r\n\r\nA preliminary stage of the project will be to survey adults in a geographic location in Los Angeles predominantly inhabited by persons under thirty years of age. These individuals will be asked about their recreational habits within their urban environment. This information will then be coordinated with ideas to develop Owens Valley as a rural recreational facility for this type of urban dweller.\r\n\r\nThe information will be compiled in three forms:\r\n\r\n\tVisual: film, cassette, videotape\r\n\r\n\tSound: real sounds of Owens Valley, short tape conversations and interviews\r\n\r\n\tGraphic interpretation: including booklet to describe method by which urban dwellers can orient themselves to rural recreation.\r\n\r\nThe suggested display in Automation House would include a brief history of the project, including, perhaps, the initial propos ls submitted and subsequent ideas and the final project. Photographs, soundtapes, and written material; documentation of the initial experience at Santa Barbara with photos, movies, and sound tapes; an orientation pamphlet to Owens Valley including density maps, infrared photography, history, photographs, along with the showing of video tapes of selected geographical locations in Owens Valley and Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThis information that is compiled can be distributed in three ways :\r\n\r\n\tHome : an individual in his own environment would be advised of recreational locations and necessary facilities needed for transition.\r\n\r\n\tMobil campers: information can be played on car cassettes en route to the recreational areas.\r\n\r\n\tAudio-visual centers: demonstrations of potential recreation uses and providing orientation for arriving recreationers.\r\n\r\nThe roving recreators include:\r\n\r\n\tJim Anderson, Director of Social and Cultural Affairs, L.A. County Department of Parks and Recreation\r\n\r\n\tJohn Braun, Professor of Fine Arts, University of Southern California\r\n\r\n\tDoug Campbell, Architect, University of California, Berkeley\r\n\r\n\tJohn Forkner, Optics Engineer, Philco-Ford \r\n\r\n\tJim Gilbert, Architect\r\n\r\n\tArdison Phillips, Administrator-E.A.T. \r\n\r\n\tMichael Plesset, Jet Propulsion Laboratory\r\n\r\nInitial contacts have been made with chemists, civil engineers and closed space systems scientists.",

        "text": "CITY AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nExperiments in Art and Technology 235 Park Avenue South \r\nNew York, New York 10003\r\nSeptember 3, 1970\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL PROJECT IN CITY AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to apply existing technology and expertise to create closed-environment systems that would make it feasible to undertake city agriculture on a wide scale. The project will include a prototype rooftop vegetable garden and a manual to instruct other groups in methods of constructing and maintaining similar gardens.\r\n\r\nThe garden will be built and maintained by Experiments in Art and Technology in collaboration with the Environmental Research Laboratory of the university of Arizona. Under a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation, the Environmental Research Laboratory has developed a pilot project in which an integrated closed-environment system for power-water-food production can yield fresh vegetables in arid coastline areas. Research facilities are operated in Tuscon and Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, Mexico. The Environmental Research Laboratory will make its horticultural and technical experience and resources available to the project.\r\n\r\nSeedlings will be grown in the nurseries of the Department of Agricultural Engineering at Rutgers University; and the New York Horticultural Society will act in an advisory capacity, and publicize the project through their channels.\r\n\r\nThe experimental garden will consist of two greenhouses whose walls are double-skin inflated plastic, as indicated in the enclosed sketch. The circular dome structure will be a self-contained unit; the half-cylinder structure can be joined to identical modules to make longer greenhouses. These greenhouses will be light enough to comply with the usual roof weight regulation for New York City, and will be mounted on wheels so that they can be moved about the roof to take advantage of changing sunlight conditions.\r\n\r\nEach greenhouse will have a climate control system which will filter and regulate the temperature and flow of air. For this project two different types of climates will be simulated. The greenhouse with the cooler climate will grow tomatoes, lettuce and radishes; the other will have aubergine, cucumber and melon. The feeding system will be an adaptation of the system developed by the Environmental Research Laboratory for growing plants in the desert; nutrients in solution will be periodically fed into the soil medium., a mixture of vermiculite and peat moss.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that each greenhouse will provide enough vegetables for a family of four. In another measure of output from such a system, it was calculated that if a rooftop garden were devoted exclusively to tomatoes, it could produce one tomato per person per day for all the inhabitants of the building.\r\n\r\nThis experimental garden is intended to serve as a prototype for city agriculture which can be repeated elsewhere in the city. The structures are being designed to be easily mass-produced, and the design is suitable for installation on any roof in New York City.

        "text": "A Vegetable Roof Garden\r\n\r\n\tThe purpose of the roof garden project, also called a demonstration project in city agriculture, was:\r\n\tTo apply existing technology and expertise to create closed- environment systems that would make it feasible to undertake city agriculture on a wide scale. (1)\r\n\tThe project was initiated by E.A.T. with the Environmental Research Laboratory (ERL), a unit of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University of Arizona. EEL, with research facilities in Tucson, Arizona, and Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, Sonora, Mexico, had been conducting experiments with greenhouses and other means to economically provide power-water-food systems for desert areas since the early 1960s.\r\n\tThose involved in the project through ERL were Carl N. Hodges, director of ERL; Merle H. Jensen, horticultural consultant; Chip Lockwood, business and funding consultant; Mahmoud M. Shabandar, architectural consultant; and David H. Pollock, Shabandar's architectural associate. Neither ERL nor the individuals involved appeared to have earlier submitted proposals for \"Projects Outside Art.\"\r\n\tPreliminary work on the project was begun about July 1970, following Peter Poole's meeting with ERL at their research facilities. Upon discussing the boundaries of the project, it was agreed that E.A.T. would collect information about the existing conditions, materials, equipment, and funding sources. ERL would prepare a set of preliminary design drawings to define the architectural and engineering scope of the work and to permit cost estimates from manufacturers.\r\n\tE.A.T.'s initial idea for a project in hydroponics, as the project was announced by E.A.T. Los Angeles, (2) was soon preempted by practical considerations. Having an entire roof cover supported by the walls of the building rather than the roof was pursued until about September 1970, when it was decided to have smaller, environmentally controlled units because of fire regulations in New York. The units were to be designed for easy mass production and installation on any roof in New York City.\r\n\tAs developed in the drawings prepared by Mahmoud Shabandar and David Pollock, two lightweight greenhouses would be made of metal skeletons on wheels covered with double-skin inflated plastic. One would be a self-contained circular dome structure and one a half-cylinder dome that might be joined to identical units for making longer greenhouses. Each would simulate a different climate : the one having lettuce, tomatoes, and radishes, the other having aubergine, cucumber, and melon.\r\n\tEnvironmental control units, using mechanical and electrical systems, would be highly sensitive and flexible to regulate the temperature and flow of air. The air would be filtered, heated, cooled, and circulated. Nutrients in solution would periodically be fed into the soil. Ideally, a variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, or flowers could thus be grown in the same units at different times, in many sites, and all year. \"The only limiting factor\" was considered to be the amount of available sunlight. (3)\r\n\tAfter evaluating the preliminary design, E.A.T. planned to select and invite additional persons, including artists, to participate in plans for the exhibition at Automation House. They apparently would help determine the final selection and layout of plants. If wanting to assure the optimum use of the units and growth of plants, their choices would need to be based on recommendations, if not necessities, of the established parameters and conditions.\r\n\tThe first documented suggestion as to how artists might participate could be inferred from Mahmoud Shabandar's suggestion for audio and visual effects, e.g., the plastic enclosures might be colored, painted, or inflated with colored gases. (4)\r\n\tIn plans as of September 1970, the College of Architecture at Rutgers State university, in cooperation with Merle Jensen, was to grow seedlings in the nurseries of the university's Department of Horticulture and Forestry. The university's Department of Agricultural Engineering was to assist in constructing and installing equipment in the greenhouses. The New York Horticultural Society was to function as an advisor and publicize the project through their channels. Oliver Selfridge at MIT was to compile a manual describing various aspects of the project for others interested in initiating and developing their own rooftop gardens.\r\n\tIn plans as of December 1970, EEL would be completely responsible for the architectural, technical, and horticultural design aspects of the greenhouses. They would also assume fund raising for these activities except for the architects' expenses and fees. E.A.T. and the American Foundation on Automation and Employment would be jointly responsible to raise funds covering the architects' fees and expenses and to generally administer the project.\r\n\tArrangements would be made to have the project promoted in New York by the mayor's office, city agencies, television programs, and New York magazine. During the time of the garden's operation atop Automation House, groups would be encouraged to initiate their own gardens and given technical assistance through E.A.T. Annual New York City roof garden competitions might be held. The gardens were to be a source of recreation, instruction, and achievement.\r\n\tThe experience gained from the prototype might also be applicable to greenhouses for commercial, educational, and other functions on the roofs of prisons, schools, hospitals, office buildings, and apartment houses. Among the possibilities E.A.T. considered were greenhouses in Chinatown, to grow vegetables not cultivated in New York; Rockefeller Plaza, to use the various levels of roofs and terraces as suggested by Julius Haber of RCA; and Westbeth, to provide artists in the housing complex with a fresh vegetable garden.\r\n\tAs another \"spin-off,\" E.A.T.'s term used in drafting general policy statements for projects, the model greenhouses would be suited for continuing experiments. Agencies concerned with the environment might sample and analyze pollutants in the air for research relating air pollution to plant growth and yield, which was of interest to the United States Department of Agriculture.(5) Plants tolerant of pollutants and low light levels might be identified, thereby further promoting possibilities for less elaborate control systems or for fresh air gardens. The project would hopefully stimulate an extensive practice of agriculture in the city.\r\n\tBasic research and design for the greenhouse units, more or less completed by about the end of January 1971, had taken longer than initally scheduled for exhibition purposes and seemed to cost more than was desired. The actual cost of having the system built and installed was estimated close to $30,000, which was called \"extremely high\" in comparison to the square feet of growing area.(6)\r\n\tAmong the potential sponsors contacted by E.A.T. between September 1970 and April 1971 were Mrs. Albert Lasker of the Richmond Foundation, Alice M. Kaplan of the J. M. Kaplan Fund, Stewart R. Mott of the Philanthropy Office, Frederick L. Bissinger of the Allied Chemical Foundation, and others including the New York Botanical Garden, W. Atlee Burpee Company, Trane Company, and G. T. Schjeldahl Company.\r\n\tEarlier in the project, Allied Chemical had offered to supply Aclar as a covering material. material. Generally, however, attempts to acquire funds or donations of materials and equipment had been unsuccessful both  by E.A.T. and ERL. \r\n\tERL's only positive result in fund raising had been through their association with Aqua-Chem Corporation, which had a small subsidiary firm called Environmental Farms in Tucson. Aqua-Chem had developed an experimental, controlled environmental unit called \"Envirodome,\" a packaged structure for use throughout the world, which heretofore had been unknown to E.A.T. It was not clear whether the units were only on paper, whether one or more had been constructed to date, or whether they were already being mass-produced. In any event, Aqua-Chem offered to sell E.A.T. a unit for $6,000, which ERL considered reasonable.\r\n\tWith assistance for installation of the unit at Automation House from the Coca-Cola Company, the parent company of Aqua-Chem, ERL suggested they might experiment with high carbon dioxide concentration and low light levels to grow bib lettuce, a specialty crop fetching a premium price.\r\n\tBilly Kl\u00fcver and Julie Martin recall that the greenhouse alternative came suddenly and unexpectedly, that purchase of the unit for the Automation House exhibition was approved by Theodore Kheel, that a contract was made but later canceled by Aqua-Chem, and that such units were later sold at Abercrombie and Fitch.(7)\r\n\tThe plans for the project remained on paper in the form of correspondence, drawings, and proposals. The fourth project announced for \"Projects Outside Art,\" a display relating to the garden, was not begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) \"Projects Outside Art: City Agriculture,\" E.A.T.'s proposal/ report, September 1, 1970, p. 1\r\n(2) E.A.T.

They have submitted a preliminary proposal to us in which the greenhouse techniques they have developed will be used to grow vegetables in a city environment.\r\n\r\nSo far we have established the following boundaries for the the project:\r\n\r\n1. The garden should be relatively cheap, easy to plant and feasible in the city environment.\r\n\r\n2. It should be all-season and covered by a polyethelene tent-like structure.\r\n\r\n3. It should produce at least tomatoes, cucumbers and egg-plants. Other plants may be added as the group working on the project decides.\r\n\r\nThe major task of the Garden project team will be to build the garden.\r\n\r\nAlthough we will try to have meetings before these dates, we would like the people who wish to work on the display aspects of the project to begin work around August 1. Those people who wish to work on the garden will be needed about September 1.",

        "text": "EXPERIMENTS IN ART AND TECHNOLOGY, INC. \r\n9 East 16 Street, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART\r\n11 West 53 Street, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe names of the American engineers who were awarded prizes in the international competition arranged by Experiments in Art and Technology in connection with The Museum of Modern Art exhibition, The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age, were announced November 11 at a press conference-demonstration at the Museum. Purpose of the competition, launched a year ago, was to find the most inventive contribution by an engineer to a work of art produced in collaboration with an artist.\r\n\tWinners of the $3,000 first prize were Harris Hyman and Ralph Martel, who collaborated with artist Jean Dupuy to construct a sculpture of dust. Frank Turner was awarded a $1,000 second prize for his contribution to Wen-Ying Tsai's cybernetic sculpture of stainless steel rods and strobe lights; Niels 0. Young also won a second prize of $1,000 for his role in making Fakir in 3/4 Time, mechanical fountain, with his artist wife Lucy Jackson Young.\r\n\tThe first prize was awarded by P. L. Siemiller, Co-chairman of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment, which donated the prize money. Mr. Siemiller is also President of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (AFL-CIO).\r\n\tThe two second prizes were donated by the McCrory Corporation and Richard Brandt, President, on behalf of the Trans-Lux Corporation.\r\n\tThe prizewinning works are included in The Museum of Modern Art exhibition on view from November 27 through February 9. At the same time, all the entries in the E.A.T. competition are being shown in an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, Some More Beginnings, opening November 26.\r\n\tIn Heart Beats Dust, first prizewinner, the essential material is red dust lying on a stretched rubber membrane enclosed in a glass-faced cube. The dust is activated by acoustic vibrations produced by the rhythm of heart beats and made visible by a light beam of high intensity. \"Like many works of recent years, Heart Beats Dust manifests a new form of cooperation with nature,\" according to Pontus Hult\u00e9n, Guest Director of The Museum of Modern Art exhibition. \"A sensitive collaboration between natural forces within and outside the human body has here been achieved.\" Hyman and Martel received special technical advice from Charles Coster and Robert Maziarz of North American Phillips, Incorporated, and Rodney F. Kaiser of Kliegl Brothers.\r\n\tFakir in 3/4 Time is a mechanical fountain. Its creators, Lucy Jackson Young and her husband, Niels 0. Young, engineer, point out that it is the first machine to do the Indian rope trick. Based on the same principle as that of the lariat, in which the motion of a loop of cord along its own length causes it to become rigid, the cord in Fakir in 3/4 Time, instead of being swung at the end of a tether, is gobbled in and spewed out again by means of an electric motor and sheave, at the rate of 100 miles an hour.\r\n\tThe Cybernetic Sculpture, created by artist and engineer Wen-Ying Tsai, is based on the principle of the harmonic motion in a \"standing wave\" produced by a vibrating rod. Multiple stainless steel units, each more than nine feet high, with a 20 inch diameter at the base, are grouped together. The visual effect when in motion is continually modulated by high frequency stroboscopic lights. The lights react to sound, such as that of a voice or the clapping of hands. The sense of contact with the sculpture that the viewer obtains is due to the subtlety of the work's reaction; the response of the trembling rods seems a direct translation of his voice. \"The technical solution that produces this illusionistic feat is at once so discreet and so efficient that it strikes us as perfect,\" Mr. Hult\u00e9n says.\r\n\tThe winning works were selected from more than 150 submissions from artists in nine countries. The jury consisted of five scientists and engineers who were not necessarily knowledgeable about contemporary art. The jurors were unfamiliar with the participating engineers. They were: James M. Brownlow, International Business Machines Research Laboratories; Michael D. Golder, Plastic Research and Development Center, Celanese Plastics Company; Cyril M. Harris, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Architecture, Columbia University; John W. Pan, Bell Telephone Laboratories; and William G.Rosen, Special Assistant to the Director, National Science Foundation, and Executive Secretary of the Committee on Academic Sciences and Engineering of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. \r\n\tIn making the awards for the most inventive use of new technology as it evolves through the collaboration of artist and engineer, the jurors were asked to base their judgements on these criteria: First, how inventive and imaginative is the use of technology? Second, to what extent have the engineer and artist collaborated successfully?\r\n\tIn making their decision, the jurors issued the following statement:\r\nIn each of the winning entries a spectrum of technology was used with great impact on the art forms. Evident is the realization that neither the artist nor the engineer alone could have achieved the results. Interaction must have preceded innovation. Going beyond a demonstration of technical prowess or an intricate orchestration of art and technology, the engineer and artist together have created more than a well-executed realization of fantasy. The unexpected and extraordinary, which one experiences on viewing these pieces, result from inventiveness and imagination, stimulated not by the brute force of technical complexity but by probing into the workings of natural laws.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the prizewinning engineers and the artists, others present at the conference were: Theodore W. Kheel, President of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment; Richard Brandt, President of Trans-Lux Corporation; Meshulam Ricklis, President of the McCrory Corporation; Bates Lowry, Director of The Museum of Modern Art; G. Pontus Hult\u00e9n, Director of Moderna Museet in Stockholm and Guest Director of The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition; Dr. Billy Kl\u00fcver, President of E.A.T.; and Robert Rauschenberg, Chairman of the Board, E.A.T.\r\n\tRepresentatives of labor and industry, who were invited, included Lane Kirkland, assistant to George Meany, President of the Central Labor Council (AFL-CIO); Ralph Gross, President of the Commerce and Industry Association; Edward Swayduck, President of Local One Amalgamated Lithographers of America; Seymour Schweber of Schweber Electronics; and At[h]elstan [Spilhaus], The Franklin Institute, Philadelphia.\r\n\tExperiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), an international organization, was established in 1967 to develop an effective collaboration between engineers and artists. [The] aim of the non-profit organization is to encourage new work which is not the preconception either the engineer or the artist but which is the result of their joint explorations.\r\n\r\nAdditional information available from Elizabeth Shaw, Director, Department of Public Information, The Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53 Street, New York, N.Y.

The dust is activated by acoustic vibrations produced by the rhythm of heart beats. As an artist, Dupuy worked with polyethylene plastic, which by generating static electricity attracts and retains dust. While seeking a means to avoid this, he had the idea of utilizing the dust itself as a medium.\r\nLike many works of recent years, Heart Beats Dust manifests a new form of cooperation with nature. A sensitive collaboration between natural forces within and outside the human body has here been achieved.\r\nAn earlier use of dust as an artistic medium was by Marcel Duchamp. While he was working on the Large\r\nGlass (see pages 80\u201481), after having left it untouched for a long time he found it covered with dust and decided to let some of it be the material for the sieves above the chocolate grinder. He fixed the dust in that area with varnish. In 1920, Man Ray took a famous photograph of this Breeding of Dust (Elevage de Poussiere).",

        "text": "EXPERIMENTS IN ART AND TECHNOLOGY, INC. \r\n9 East 16 Street, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART\r\n11 West 53 Street, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe names of the American engineers who were awarded prizes in the international competition arranged by Experiments in Art and Technology in connection with The Museum of Modern Art exhibition, The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age, were announced November 11 at a press conference-demonstration at the Museum. Purpose of the competition, launched a year ago, was to find the most inventive contribution by an engineer to a work of art produced in collaboration with an artist.\r\n\tWinners of the $3,000 first prize were Harris Hyman and Ralph Martel, who collaborated with artist Jean Dupuy to construct a sculpture of dust. Frank Turner was awarded a $1,000 second prize for his contribution to Wen-Ying Tsai's cybernetic sculpture of stainless steel rods and strobe lights; Niels 0. Young also won a second prize of $1,000 for his role in making Fakir in 3/4 Time, mechanical fountain, with his artist wife Lucy Jackson Young.\r\n\tThe first prize was awarded by P. L. Siemiller, Co-chairman of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment, which donated the prize money. Mr. Siemiller is also President of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (AFL-CIO).\r\n\tThe two second prizes were donated by the McCrory Corporation and Richard Brandt, President, on behalf of the Trans-Lux Corporation.\r\n\tThe prizewinning works are included in The Museum of Modern Art exhibition on view from November 27 through February 9. At the same time, all the entries in the E.A.T. competition are being shown in an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, Some More Beginnings, opening November 26.\r\n\tIn Heart Beats Dust, first prizewinner, the essential material is red dust lying on a stretched rubber membrane enclosed in a glass-faced cube. The dust is activated by acoustic vibrations produced by the rhythm of heart beats and made visible by a light beam of high intensity. \"Like many works of recent years, Heart Beats Dust manifests a new form of cooperation with nature,\" according to Pontus Hult\u00e9n, Guest Director of The Museum of Modern Art exhibition. \"A sensitive collaboration between natural forces within and outside the human body has here been achieved.\" Hyman and Martel received special technical advice from Charles Coster and Robert Maziarz of North American Phillips, Incorporated, and Rodney F. Kaiser of Kliegl Brothers.\r\n\tFakir in 3/4 Time is a mechanical fountain. Its creators, Lucy Jackson Young and her husband, Niels 0. Young, engineer, point out that it is the first machine to do the Indian rope trick. Based on the same principle as that of the lariat, in which the motion of a loop of cord along its own length causes it to become rigid, the cord in Fakir in 3/4 Time, instead of being swung at the end of a tether, is gobbled in and spewed out again by means of an electric motor and sheave, at the rate of 100 miles an hour.\r\n\tThe Cybernetic Sculpture, created by artist and engineer Wen-Ying Tsai, is based on the principle of the harmonic motion in a \"standing wave\" produced by a vibrating rod. Multiple stainless steel units, each more than nine feet high, with a 20 inch diameter at the base, are grouped together. The visual effect when in motion is continually modulated by high frequency stroboscopic lights. The lights react to sound, such as that of a voice or the clapping of hands. The sense of contact with the sculpture that the viewer obtains is due to the subtlety of the work's reaction; the response of the trembling rods seems a direct translation of his voice. \"The technical solution that produces this illusionistic feat is at once so discreet and so efficient that it strikes us as perfect,\" Mr. Hult\u00e9n says.\r\n\tThe winning works were selected from more than 150 submissions from artists in nine countries. The jury consisted of five scientists and engineers who were not necessarily knowledgeable about contemporary art. The jurors were unfamiliar with the participating engineers. They were: James M. Brownlow, International Business Machines Research Laboratories; Michael D. Golder, Plastic Research and Development Center, Celanese Plastics Company; Cyril M. Harris, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Architecture, Columbia University; John W. Pan, Bell Telephone Laboratories; and William G.Rosen, Special Assistant to the Director, National Science Foundation, and Executive Secretary of the Committee on Academic Sciences and Engineering of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. \r\n\tIn making the awards for the most inventive use of new technology as it evolves through the collaboration of artist and engineer, the jurors were asked to base their judgements on these criteria: First, how inventive and imaginative is the use of technology? Second, to what extent have the engineer and artist collaborated successfully?\r\n\tIn making their decision, the jurors issued the following statement:\r\nIn each of the winning entries a spectrum of technology was used with great impact on the art forms. Evident is the realization that neither the artist nor the engineer alone could have achieved the results. Interaction must have preceded innovation. Going beyond a demonstration of technical prowess or an intricate orchestration of art and technology, the engineer and artist together have created more than a well-executed realization of fantasy. The unexpected and extraordinary, which one experiences on viewing these pieces, result from inventiveness and imagination, stimulated not by the brute force of technical complexity but by probing into the workings of natural laws.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the prizewinning engineers and the artists, others present at the conference were: Theodore W. Kheel, President of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment; Richard Brandt, President of Trans-Lux Corporation; Meshulam Ricklis, President of the McCrory Corporation; Bates Lowry, Director of The Museum of Modern Art; G. Pontus Hult\u00e9n, Director of Moderna Museet in Stockholm and Guest Director of The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition; Dr. Billy Kl\u00fcver, President of E.A.T.; and Robert Rauschenberg, Chairman of the Board, E.A.T.\r\n\tRepresentatives of labor and industry, who were invited, included Lane Kirkland, assistant to George Meany, President of the Central Labor Council (AFL-CIO); Ralph Gross, President of the Commerce and Industry Association; Edward Swayduck, President of Local One Amalgamated Lithographers of America; Seymour Schweber of Schweber Electronics; and At[h]elstan [Spilhaus], The Franklin Institute, Philadelphia.\r\n\tExperiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), an international organization, was established in 1967 to develop an effective collaboration between engineers and artists. [The] aim of the non-profit organization is to encourage new work which is not the preconception either the engineer or the artist but which is the result of their joint explorations.\r\n\r\nAdditional information available from Elizabeth Shaw, Director, Department of Public Information, The Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53 Street, New York, N.Y.

American, born 1930 (engineer) \r\nFakir in 3/4 Time 1968\r\nBase : aluminum, plastic and motors, approximately 30\u201d high by 25\u201d wide x 16 deep ; fountain effect : textile cord or tape, adjusting from 4 to 40\u2019 above base\r\n\r\nThe creators of this mechanical fountain point out that it is the first machine to do the Indian rope trick. The basic principle by which a loop of otherwise limp cord could be coaxed into apparent rigidity and made to stand up was discovered only a couple of years ago. It is the same principle as that of the lariat, in which the motion of a loop of cord along its own length causes it to become rigid. In Fakir in 3/4 Time, the cord, instead of being swung at the end of a tether, is gobbled in and spewed out again by means of an electric motor and sheave, at the rate of 100 miles per hour. Because of its speed, the stream of cord resists deflection until it reaches the end of its loop, when it has to turn about and return to the machine. The head operates by means of a vacuum capstan.\r\nFakir in 3/4 Time has the elegance of a very simple solution. The choreography of this mechanical fountain is manually adjustable, but theoretically it could be programmed in a way similar to Arm (opposite).",

There are alternative methods of operation.

Bean\r\nConstructed of the 20 Plastic rods radiating from a collar that curves around 2 sides of a moire-covered tetrahedron and a rotating edgelit clear plastic sunburst, there are 5 distinct actions, controlled by foot switches operated by viewers: rods light up in sequence from 1 to 20, or in reverse; all the rods are lighted and blink slowly; the sunburst rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise. An input circuit periodically samples the rapidily changing patterns of sensor signals and duplicates the sample in an input register. The latter is a set of bistable device each corresponding to a switch. The state of these devices remains constant for the duration of the interval (corresponding to 20 pulses) and determines the action of the operating network. The operating network is basically a double-decade counter consisting of flip-flop storage elements and a balanced decoding matrix. [p.27-28]",

THIS CONTAINS 2 MORE ACRYLIC BUBBLES OF DIFFERENT SIZES WHICH ARE LIGHTED FROM THE BACK AT A PROGRAMMED RATE, PRODUCING COLORED LIGHT ON THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE LARGER BUBBLE. THE MOVABLE \"PUSH-LITE\" FLOWER SHAPE FORMS ARE MADE OF ACRYLIC AND STYRENE, EACH COVERING AN INCANDESCENT LAMP WITH A DIODE IN SERIES WITH THE LAMP AND A COAXIAL MALE CONNECTOR. THE \"PUSH-LITE\" FLOWERS CAN BE MOVED ABOUT THE FACE OF THE PANEL; THEIR POSITIONS DETERMINE WHICH OF 2 DIFFERENT SOLID STATE MODULES (METRONOME OR BIRD CALL) WILL BE ACTIVATED IN ADDITION TO THE LIGHT.\r\n\r\nSIDE B CONSISTS BASICALLY OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS SIDE A, EXCEPT THAT THE BUBBLE AT THE TOP IS OF BLUE PLEXIGLAS NO. 2061 AND CONTAINS PROGRAMMED FLASHING LIGHTS. A \"PUSH-LITE\" ON THE FACE OF A PHOTOGRAPHED CLOCK ACTIVATES A BELL RING.\r\n\r\nON BOTH SIDES A AND B, MOVEMENT OF THE \"PUSH-LITE\" FLOWERS PRODUCES STEADY OR ELECTRONICALLY PROGRAMMED FLASHING LIGHTS.\r\n\r\nON SIDE C (AN ANODIZED BLACK 1/16\" ALUMINUM SHEET), FOUR 7/8' STEEL BALLS ARE MOVED BY 4 ALNICO PERMANENT MAGNETS FROM RADAR MAGNETRONS WHICH ARE MOUNTED ON 4 SEPARATE SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS OF DIFFERENTS SPEEDS. ACRYLIC RODS AT TOP AND BOTTOM CONDUCT LIGHT FROM MIDGET INCANDESCENT LAMPS, AT THE BOTTOM A TAPE SWITCH MATE ACTIVATES A SOLID STATE ELECTRONIC SIREN MODULE.\r\n\r\nENCLOSED BY THE 3 PANELS, A PRESET TIMER CONTROLS A CONTINUOUS TAPE CARTRIDGE RECORDER WHICH PLAYS A CHILD'S NARRATION. THE TIMER IS ACTIVATED BY INITIAL MOVEMENT OF THE \"PUSH-LITE\" FLOWERS.",

Film is, of course, a medium in which there is a constant, natural, and for the most part unproblematic collaboration between artists and engineers, who jointly develop an increasingly refined technique.\r\nAll of Hilary Harris\u2019 earlier work \u2014 which has included dance, still photography, sculpture, and film \u2014 has concentrated on movement as its underlying theme. In Arm, a highly advanced mechanical technology is used in combination with electronics to create a nonfigurative choreography. Each of the five articulated elements is capable of independent movement. The motor within each one is controlled by a master motor in the base, and this in turn reacts to instructions, programmed by the choreographer, which are read continuously by the mobile as it performs.",

A HIGH-FREQUENCY, HIGH-VOLTAGE GENERATOR IS COUPLED TO AN INSULATED POINTED METALLIC STYLUS. HIGH-FREQUENCY ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED FROM THE TIP OF THE STYLUS TO THE CONDUCTIVE WOOD AND RESULTS IN AN ARC WHICH ENGRAVES THE SURFACE WITHOUT THE APPLICATION OF PRESSURE. THE SPEED OF ENGRAVING IS APPROXIMATELY 4-7 MM/SEC.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH-FREQUENCY ENERGY IS GENERATED USING A 100 KHZ OSCILLATOR COUPLED TO A COIL CONSISTING OF 1,200 TURNS OF COPPER WIRE, WHICH GENERATES 35,000 VOLTS. THIS VOLTAGE IS RECTIFIED AND FED TO THE STYLUS. \r\n\r\nTWO STYLI MAY BE USED: AN ENGRAVING STYLUS HELD IN THE RIGHT HAND AN AUXILIARY STYLUS IN THE LEFT. THE LATTER IS USED FOR FINISHING AND FOLLOWS THE ENGRAVING STYLUS AT A DISTANCE OF 5-6 MM. FINER ENGRAVING CAN BE MADE BY REDUCING THE HIGH-FREQUENCY POWER.",

SIMON\r\nTHIS PROCESS INVOLVES THE APPLICATION OF HIGH-VOLTAGE PARTICLE ACCELERATORS AND THE SPARK DISCHARGE PHENOMENA WHICH RESULTS FROM IRRADIATION OF CERTAIN PLASTICS.\r\n\r\nWHEN MONOENERGETIC ELECTRONS STOP IN A POLYMER, A NEGATIVE SPACE CHARGE BUILDS UP IN A PLANE PERPENDICULAR TO THE INCIDENT BEAM. THE DEPTH OF PENETRATION IS RELATED TO THE ACCELERATOR VOLTAGE. AFTER IRRADIATION, THE SPACE CHARGE CONCENTRATION CAN BE DISCHARGED BY PASSING A SHARP METAL OBJECT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE ELECTRON PLANE. THE DISCHARGE PRODUCES A PERMANENT AND CHARACTERISTIC PATTERN CALLED A \"LICHTENBERG FIGURE\"-PROBABLY A RESULT OF A DEPOLYMERIZATION OF THE POLYMER. THE UNIQUE CRAZING IN THE CASE OF A CLEAR PLASTIC IS COMPOSED OF SMALL CAVITIES AND HOLLOW CHANNELS. WHEN END-LIGHTED, THE PATTERNS ARE ACCENTUATED BY THE INTERNAL REFLECTION IN THE FIGURE.\r\n\r\nIT IS POSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE POSITION OF THE DISCHARGE BY SHIELDING REGIONS OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL WHERE NO DISCHARGE IS DESIRED. CONTROL OF THE VOLTAGE DETERMINES THE DEPTH OF THE DISCHARGE, AND BY COLORING THE BACK OF THE PLASTIC MATERIALS AND USING LIGHTING, THE ARTIST WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS EFFECT.

        "text": "EXPERIMENTS IN ART AND TECHNOLOGY, INC. \r\n9 East 16 Street, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART\r\n11 West 53 Street, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe names of the American engineers who were awarded prizes in the international competition arranged by Experiments in Art and Technology in connection with The Museum of Modern Art exhibition, The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age, were announced November 11 at a press conference-demonstration at the Museum. Purpose of the competition, launched a year ago, was to find the most inventive contribution by an engineer to a work of art produced in collaboration with an artist.\r\n\tWinners of the $3,000 first prize were Harris Hyman and Ralph Martel, who collaborated with artist Jean Dupuy to construct a sculpture of dust. Frank Turner was awarded a $1,000 second prize for his contribution to Wen-Ying Tsai's cybernetic sculpture of stainless steel rods and strobe lights; Niels 0. Young also won a second prize of $1,000 for his role in making Fakir in 3/4 Time, mechanical fountain, with his artist wife Lucy Jackson Young.\r\n\tThe first prize was awarded by P. L. Siemiller, Co-chairman of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment, which donated the prize money. Mr. Siemiller is also President of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (AFL-CIO).\r\n\tThe two second prizes were donated by the McCrory Corporation and Richard Brandt, President, on behalf of the Trans-Lux Corporation.\r\n\tThe prizewinning works are included in The Museum of Modern Art exhibition on view from November 27 through February 9. At the same time, all the entries in the E.A.T. competition are being shown in an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, Some More Beginnings, opening November 26.\r\n\tIn Heart Beats Dust, first prizewinner, the essential material is red dust lying on a stretched rubber membrane enclosed in a glass-faced cube. The dust is activated by acoustic vibrations produced by the rhythm of heart beats and made visible by a light beam of high intensity. \"Like many works of recent years, Heart Beats Dust manifests a new form of cooperation with nature,\" according to Pontus Hult\u00e9n, Guest Director of The Museum of Modern Art exhibition. \"A sensitive collaboration between natural forces within and outside the human body has here been achieved.\" Hyman and Martel received special technical advice from Charles Coster and Robert Maziarz of North American Phillips, Incorporated, and Rodney F. Kaiser of Kliegl Brothers.\r\n\tFakir in 3/4 Time is a mechanical fountain. Its creators, Lucy Jackson Young and her husband, Niels 0. Young, engineer, point out that it is the first machine to do the Indian rope trick. Based on the same principle as that of the lariat, in which the motion of a loop of cord along its own length causes it to become rigid, the cord in Fakir in 3/4 Time, instead of being swung at the end of a tether, is gobbled in and spewed out again by means of an electric motor and sheave, at the rate of 100 miles an hour.\r\n\tThe Cybernetic Sculpture, created by artist and engineer Wen-Ying Tsai, is based on the principle of the harmonic motion in a \"standing wave\" produced by a vibrating rod. Multiple stainless steel units, each more than nine feet high, with a 20 inch diameter at the base, are grouped together. The visual effect when in motion is continually modulated by high frequency stroboscopic lights. The lights react to sound, such as that of a voice or the clapping of hands. The sense of contact with the sculpture that the viewer obtains is due to the subtlety of the work's reaction; the response of the trembling rods seems a direct translation of his voice. \"The technical solution that produces this illusionistic feat is at once so discreet and so efficient that it strikes us as perfect,\" Mr. Hult\u00e9n says.\r\n\tThe winning works were selected from more than 150 submissions from artists in nine countries. The jury consisted of five scientists and engineers who were not necessarily knowledgeable about contemporary art. The jurors were unfamiliar with the participating engineers. They were: James M. Brownlow, International Business Machines Research Laboratories; Michael D. Golder, Plastic Research and Development Center, Celanese Plastics Company; Cyril M. Harris, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Architecture, Columbia University; John W. Pan, Bell Telephone Laboratories; and William G.Rosen, Special Assistant to the Director, National Science Foundation, and Executive Secretary of the Committee on Academic Sciences and Engineering of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. \r\n\tIn making the awards for the most inventive use of new technology as it evolves through the collaboration of artist and engineer, the jurors were asked to base their judgements on these criteria: First, how inventive and imaginative is the use of technology? Second, to what extent have the engineer and artist collaborated successfully?\r\n\tIn making their decision, the jurors issued the following statement:\r\nIn each of the winning entries a spectrum of technology was used with great impact on the art forms. Evident is the realization that neither the artist nor the engineer alone could have achieved the results. Interaction must have preceded innovation. Going beyond a demonstration of technical prowess or an intricate orchestration of art and technology, the engineer and artist together have created more than a well-executed realization of fantasy. The unexpected and extraordinary, which one experiences on viewing these pieces, result from inventiveness and imagination, stimulated not by the brute force of technical complexity but by probing into the workings of natural laws.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the prizewinning engineers and the artists, others present at the conference were: Theodore W. Kheel, President of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment; Richard Brandt, President of Trans-Lux Corporation; Meshulam Ricklis, President of the McCrory Corporation; Bates Lowry, Director of The Museum of Modern Art; G. Pontus Hult\u00e9n, Director of Moderna Museet in Stockholm and Guest Director of The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition; Dr. Billy Kl\u00fcver, President of E.A.T.; and Robert Rauschenberg, Chairman of the Board, E.A.T.\r\n\tRepresentatives of labor and industry, who were invited, included Lane Kirkland, assistant to George Meany, President of the Central Labor Council (AFL-CIO); Ralph Gross, President of the Commerce and Industry Association; Edward Swayduck, President of Local One Amalgamated Lithographers of America; Seymour Schweber of Schweber Electronics; and At[h]elstan [Spilhaus], The Franklin Institute, Philadelphia.\r\n\tExperiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), an international organization, was established in 1967 to develop an effective collaboration between engineers and artists. [The] aim of the non-profit organization is to encourage new work which is not the preconception either the engineer or the artist but which is the result of their joint explorations.\r\n\r\nAdditional information available from Elizabeth Shaw, Director, Department of Public Information, The Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53 Street, New York, N.Y.

        "text": "129. WALTHER\r\nTHE FLOWER BUDS ON THIS DRAWING WERE CREATED BY SHOOTING MICROCAPSULES OF OIL PAINT ONTO A CANVAS PANEL. THE OIL-CONTAINING CAPSULES WERE PRODUCED UTILIZING THE PROCESS OF MICROENCAPSULATION. THE CAPSULE IS DRY, FREE FLOWING, AND APPEARS TO BE SOLID BUT IS APPROXIMATELY 90% LIQUID. THE LIQUID CAN BE RELEASED BY APPLYING PRESSURE TO RUPTURE THE HARD WALL MATERIAL.\r\n\r\nTHE ABILITY TO MAKE A POLYMER GO IN AND OUT OF SOLUTION IS THE KEY TO THE TECHNIQUE OF MICROENCAPSULATION. THE FIRST STEP WAS TO PRODUCE A SOLUTION OF THE WALL MATERIAL, IN THIS CASE A WATER-SOLUBLE GELATIN. THE LIQUID TO BE ENCAPSULATED WAS ARTIST OIL DISSOLVED IN TURPENTINE. THIS IMMISCIBLE LIQUID WAS ADDED THE WATERGELATIN SOLUTION AND AGITATED UNTIL THE DESIRED SIZE DROPLETS WERE FORMED. AT THIS POINT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POLYMER SOLUTIONS-WERE ALTERED BY CHANGING THE pH FOR SOLUTION TO BRING ABOUT PHASE SEPARATION OF THE WALL MATERIAL. AS THE POLYMER COMES OUT OF SOLUTION, IT WRAPS AROUND THE OIL DROPLET. THE CAPSULES ARE THEN REMOVED FROM THE SOLUTION, AND THE WATER IS REMOVED FROM THE GELATIN WALL BY DRYING. \r\n\r\nTHE SHOOTING OF THE CAPSULES WAS DONE BY PLACING THEM IN A TUBE AND RELEASING 80 PSI AIR BEHIND THE CAPSULE.",

PARALLEL CHAINS TRIGGER NEON LAMP DRIVER CIRCUITS TO CAUSE A BARRED PATTERN OF LIGHT TO MOVE ACROSS THE BOARD. THE DIFFERENTIAL TRIGGERING OF THE SHIFT REGISTERS BY THE VARIOUS PULSING CIRCUITS PRODUCES DISPLACEMENT OF THE PATTERNS, WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY ADJUSTING THE VARIABLE PULSE GENERATORS.\r\n\r\nTHREE COMPLEXES OF CHAINS ARE EMPLOYED TO CONTROL SHIFTING IN INCREMENTS OF 120 DEGREES. THE COMPLEXES ARE ACTIVATED IN SEQUENCE BY A THREE-STAGE COUNTER.",

THE SIGNAL FROM THE SPEAKER IS AMPLIFIED BY A SMALL PREAMP MODULE WHICH IS SUPPLIED FROM A 6 V REGULATED SUPPLY. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SPEAKER AND OF THE OUTPUT IS CONTROLLED BY SEPARATE PENTENTIOMETERS. THE AMPLIFIED SIGNAL IS BOOSTED BY A 20 W POWER AMPLIFIER WITH A SELF CONTAINED 45 V SUPPLY, AND THE BOOSTED SIGNAL IS FED TO A THREE-CHANNEL MODULATOR. IN THE MODULATOR, THE SIGNAL IS SENT THROUGH THREE POTENTIOMETERS TO THREE INPUT TRANSFORMERS. THE OUT PUT OF THE TRANSFORMERS IS PARTIALLY FILTERED AND SENT TO PREBIAS THE TRIGGER DIODES OF 3 SCP IF A SIGNAL IS PRESENT, THE DIODES ARE PREBIASED AND FIRE EARLIER IN THE SCR CYCLE, THUS INCREASING THE POWER OUTPUT FROM THE SCR'S TO THE SCULPTURE'S LIGHTS. THE SCR'S ARE SUPPLIED BY A 10 A DIODE BRIDGE RECTIFIER AND ARE EQUIPPED WITH BACKGROUND CONTROLS AS WELL AS SENSITIVITY CONTROLS. THE MODULATED OUTPUT FROM THE 3 SCR CHANNELS GOES TO 3 LEDEX MOTOR-ROTATED WAFER SWITCHES WHICH CHANGE THE DESTINATION OF THE MODULATED POWER IN A PROGRAMMED CYCLE. EACH SCULPTURE UNIT HAS A SEPARATE SWITCH ROTATING AT A DIFFERENT SPEED TO SHUNT THE POWER TO ITS OWN SET OF BULBS. THIS PRODUCES AN INFINITE SET OF PERMUTATIONS OF POSITIONS AND INTENSITIES.",

I shall correlate\r\nthe rate of flow of people through the Pavilion with the rate of\r\nvisual and audio information in my program. If there are fewer visitors, I will slow down the rate of visible and audible information, thus encouraging people to remain in the Pavilion longer, because they will tend to walk until another event is presented. Thus, with fewer people there would be a subdued type of activity. As more\r\nand more people come through the Pavilion, the rate of information\r\npresented will be speeded up. The activities will be more intense, and people will get more in a shorter time and tend to move through faster. This means that no matter what the circumstance, how few or how many people are going through the Pavilion in a given length of time, they would receive approximately the same amount of information. I should like to automate this by hooking up the crowd-control counter with the Master Programmer, so that the rate of flow of visitors could control the rate at which the programmer was running the program.\r\n\tI want to make as much audio and visual interaction as possible,\r\nusing the ability of the lights to be programmed by the audio. \r\n\tI shall program the laser deflection system, in addition to normal program tapes that are not beard but make visual patterns. I shall use the sounds in the Pavilion that can be picked up in the\r\nClam Room to operate the laser display. At other times the sounds\r\nthat will be in the normal laser program tapes will be heard in the\r\nhandsets of visitors entering the Clam Room, so they will be seeing what they are hearing.",

        "text": "Sandy Daley and Nicholas Quennell\r\n\r\n\tThis proposal attempts to use the Pavilion as a crude analogue for a more complex idea that we have been considering for some time. The aim is to have a number of people produce a single design. Using some form of feed-back system the group could respond to each other's contributions and produce a single unified result.\r\n\tThe problem of group participation in the design process, whether it be six people around a conference table or sixty in a\r\ncommunity, is that of recording and visualizing the various individual\r\ncontributions so that a total product can emerge, rather than the accretion of a series of individual ideas.\r\n\tWe would attempt setting up simple design problems (a park, a\r\nrestaurant, or simply an arrangement of arbitrary color or form). Visitors would be invited to pick up light-weight symbolic elements\r\nrepresenting such things as trees, walls, or tables.

        "text": "John Forkner:\r\n\r\nProgramming the Pavilion Dome as a Giant Light Machine\r\n\r\n\tGeneral: There is an interesting possibility of transforming the entire Mirror dame into a giant light machine, The visual and audio effects produced would be under direct, live control of performers (and/or audience) moving over the surface of a large, flexible mirror located either in the Clam Room or on the main floor. The deflection of light generated by the performers' motions distorting the mirror would produce moving patterns of light passing over the audience on the main floor-visible to them on each other and also as imaged in the dome. In addition, the patterns of light would be sensed by a number of photodetectors placed around the dome floor, and the signals received would be used to produce or control sounds within the dome. Thus, both sound and light would be controlled by the performers, and the audience itself would in a sense be the screen for the projected light.\r\n\r\n\tOptics: The physical basis for generating the visual effects lies in the focusing properties of a spherical mirror. An intense light source would be placed halfway between the center of the spherical dome and the top (the infinity of focus), and under these conditions the dome would serve as a huge searchlight reflector creating a broad column of parallel light. This shaft of light would descend through the large glass window in the main floor and pass into the Clam Room. An area of the Clam Room floor equal to the size of the window would be covered by plastic mirror material supported on a flexible base (foam rubber or similar material). If undisturbed, this basically flat mirror would return the column of light back through the Clam Room ceiling window and onto the dome surface, where the dome would refocus the light again near the original source. After passing through this second focus, the light would then spread out over the entire floor of the dome. Any distortion of the flat mirror on the Clam Room floor such as produced by performers moving over the mirror surface -causes deviations in the arrival of light at the second focal point. Masks and/or colored filters or plastic diffraction gratings placed at this second focus would strongly modify the light as it reaches the dome floor, thereby producing organic patterns of light moving across the audience. Thus the system would function as a large, rather coarse Schlieren optical system, which magnifies the mirror distortions initiated by the performers.\r\n\tThe same results could be effected with the flexible mirror located above the window in the main floor, however the possibility of involving both floors in the experience seems to be worth pursuing.\r\n\tAudio: A very close integration of the sound with the light patterns is possible by installing a number of light-sensing detectors in the dome floor area. The signals from these detectors could he used in several ways: (1) to generate sounds directly, e.g., through voltage-controlled oscillators (frequency of sound proportional to light intensity); (2) to control the local volume and hence the apparent direction of sounds centrally generated (either live or prerecorded, e.g., musicians strolling around flexible mirror producing \"mirror-image\" sound locations upstairs): (3) to control the permanently installed dome lighting (by suitable shielding of the detectors to discriminate the source of light). By using color filters on the detectors different sound qualities (pitch, timbre, etc.) could be triggered by the colors of the local areas of the moving light patterns.\r\n\r\n\tPerformance (participation): The real-time control of light and\r\nsound permitted by the proposed programming approach suggests various modes of performances: (1) Professional dancers, performing with or without visual feedback to the light patterns that they generate (the patterns on the main floor would be visible as images in the dome as seen through the Clam Room ceiling), visual feedback is easier if the dancers lie on the mirror and slide around its surface; (2) musicians performing with visual and audio feedback from dome (wearing earphones so audience in Clam Room does not hear light-pattern generated sounds in dome, but musicians do); (3) \"performer-teachers\" who give short series of movement/light/sound demonstrations to Clam Room audience and then invite participation.",

Three differently colored, intensely glowing balls of light move at random and at random velocities, over the surface of the sphere. Large dish-shaped mirrors, tilted at various angles, and placed throughout the floor area, reflect the images on the sphere, each other, and the people moving on the floor. A very low, throbbing sound fills the space in steady waves. A voice over the P.A. begins a continuing countdown of seconds: \"Minus [p.296] 3, minus 2, minus 1, minus zero\" {action begins) \"plus 1, plus 2, plus 3, plus 4 ...,\" until conclusion.(1)\r\nVisitors, equipped with light-beam guns, begin shooting at zero countdown. By aiming at a reflection of a light ball on any mirrored surface, they attempt to destroy the light balls. Direct hits result in huge flashes of light and terrific concussion noises.(2)\r\nAt the end of seven minutes of shooting, all sounds and light balls fade out and the houselights come up slowly. The announcer's voice now says (in successive languages perhaps): \"Ladies and Gentlemen. You are (say) \"Group 239. You have scored 46 direct hits, 122 near-misses. You are 89th on the power scale, since shooting began. Group 105, on May 13th at 1:15 p.m., achieved a record of 67 hits and only 32 near-misses. It is in control. We welcome you to try again.\" A big scoreboard, such as at ball parks, flashes the records as the visitors file out.(3)\r\n\r\n1 It is suggested that balls of light be projected from glass floor in the center of the dome. Low-frequency throbbing sounds may be just above the audible range, but still within the palpable (gut) range. Dish mirrors on the floor may be made of wood with mylar surface.\r\n2 Light-beam guns may be inexpensive, plastic toy flashlights fitted with lenses. The impulse-response system may be photocell type, located in or around projectors on floor. The light from guns pointed at light balls' virtual images will angle back to their sources and will activate the photocells located there to trigger, in turn, the explosion effect. Conversely, shots at so-called real images of the light balls, appearing on either the dishlike mirrors, or in real space, will produce no reaction. If desired, moments when some or all light balls will be \"duds,\" even if directly shot, can be programmed into the switching system. These combined confusions should reduce the odds enough to prevent constant high scoring.\r\n3 The scoreboard may be simply hooked into the traffic-flow computer provided.",

        "text": "Takehisa Kosugi: \r\nSomething Like a Fifteen-Minute Solar Eclipse\r\n\r\nThis is a programming of light and sounds repeated every fifteen minutes. With partial participation of visitors to the performance, the programming will be altered at any time.\r\nIn one cycle of the process, the proposer is intending to let visitors experience an environmental event of light and sound effects that will occur in phenomena that change little by little\u2014something like a fifteen-minute solar eclipse.\r\nFollowing are the details of the programs. These programs will be carried on simultaneously, being influenced by one another, light by sounds and sounds by light.\r\n\r\nLight Programming I: Facilitating lighting systems in the dome will be changing from brightness to darkness and again to bright- ness like the change of light in a solar eclipse. The time length of one cycle will be fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nLight Programming II: About seven turning lights will be installed in midair. Each, with different colors, light directions, or turning speed, throws a beam into the space.\r\n\r\nLight Programming III: Seven visitors will put on, at will, light hats (with turning lights installed, light-weight and controlled by batteries) of different colored lights. In accordance with the visitors' [p.298] movements, sources of light will change freely. As the eclipse comes to its peak, a whirlpool of colored light appears in harmony with lighting effects produced by Light Programming II.\r\n\r\nLight Programming IV: As a usual part of programming, lighting of the loop system will be programmed. At the highest point of eclipse, every light seems to shine like a star at night.\r\n\r\nSound Programming I: Music composed by various sounds, which will be picked up from the sound library (such as animal cries, movements, or sounds in our daily lives), will be heard through dome speakers and handsets held by visitors. When it is bright in the dome, the music will be performed as it is, but, as eclipse goes on, the music will be varied. Signals for variation are mainly those produced by Sound Programmings III and IV.\r\n\r\nSound Programming II: Electronic sounds produced by a combination of rf oscillators and receivers, will be played through dome speakers. These sounds will suggest to visitors something like birds' twittering, speeding cars, and other sounds made in our everyday life, and also those strange voices and sounds made by animals. Sometimes very peculiar sounds that have special effects, like sounds from cosmic space, will come through the speakers. Every sound will be tape-recorded stereophonically.\r\n\r\nSound Programming III: About seven CdS cell-controlled sound oscillator transmitters, which will be installed in a condition to react to lights programmed in Light Programming II, will work as a kind of multivibrator. Reacting to the brightness of light, sound frequency will change. Sounds from the speakers will have an effect as sounds themselves, and, at the same time, will be used as signals for sound variation from Sound Programming I.\r\n\r\nSound Programming IV: About seven CdS cell oscillators will be fitted up in hats (operated by batteries, with radio-wave transmitters installed) and will be put on by volunteer visitors. When the visitor with the hat on comes close to a visitor with a light hat of light programming, they will enjoy special effects of light and sound. The sounds in this system will not only be used as music itself, but as a carrier for sound variation, too.",

        "text": "Anthony Martin:\r\nDome Works I \r\nA combination of Water-Light Cycle, Silent Light, Cookery\r\n\r\nThis proposal is based on a fundamental cycle of one. Within the course of this involution-revolution are various, some optional, strata that are also cycles of activity with durations of one in fifteen minutes to a rapid vibratory beat.\r\nMode I. Water Cycle: A cloth siphon is rigged under a winch light so that there is a flow of waterdrops down through, or ending at, the focal point of the dome. At the center is placed a transparent receptacle containing one-half inch of water and between one foot and three feet in diameter. A low-power portable laser either argon or helium-neon, one milliwatt is directed upward through the drops and diffused at the top. A, b, and c superspots are directed obliquely into the dish at smallest iris aperture. Spots cross-fade in seven-second intervals.\r\nSome of the results are: an overall reflection of wave forms created by the drops, an expansion and contraction of the drops' image\u2014real image will ascend as it goes through focal length [signe???] and focal point.\r\nMode II. Vulgar Mode\u2014Light-Cookery: A performer conducts light-cookery on floor, perhaps the berm area for optimum optical usefulness.\r\nApparatus: (1) reflective buckets, pots having various light sources in them; (2) liquid illuminate (luminol-alkaline-oxidizing solution, which is poured using transparent containers); (3) glow balls are thrown, juggled, rolled; (4) one xenon beam-light used with various reflectors and prisms; (5) one spot, its tilt function externalized through shielded cable and interfaced with photoresistor at end of loop, another spot, its pan mirror function externalized.\r\nTotal: four looped wires from console. These are activated by the cook and surrounding visitors using hand-set lights to illuminate the photocells. One ground loop in the performing area is used. This deploys two arcs: a three hundred sixty-degree vertical circular plane and a horizontal plane in the twenty-inch-diameter circumference. [p.302]\r\nMode III. System Mode: This is the automatic light-sound mode mainly of the vibratory and rotational light (weather) cycle.\r\nSound: (1) Singing mode. Continuous, melodious voice, very singular clear-tape or live. Like good pop, female or husky but clear! alto-soprano. One source rotates in spiral order on speakers from top to bottom ring and back, cyclic, the rate fluctuates from one to thirty-seven speakers per second. Movement then will change in its rate relationship to top-bottom cycle.\r\n(2) Banging, crashing, thunder mode. Three channels are sound-modified and sent through all speakers, like Paul Bunyan or Toshiro Mifune crashing through a wood.\r\n(3) Electric Bass, live or taped, interfaced with a photocell activated by lights in minutes one through five and twelve through fifteen of the cycle. Gong and finger cymbals are also photocell-gated.\r\nMode IV. Silent Mode: Basic Cycle Alternates: (1) cookery replaces water cycle; (2) water cycle replaces vibratory light cycle and cookery is placed in center of cycle; (3) no use of cookery; (4) pendulum lights.\r\nThe use of the Pavilion in this proposal will have a very wide dynamic range, especially the visual results of the cycle. The object is to have as much transmutation of the environment and as much observation and response of the visitors as possible in the basic cycle of fifteen minutes. It doesn't matter when people enter into the activity; there will be a transmutation of the space in any seven-to twenty-minute stay.",

        "text": "Pauline Oliveros and Lynn Lonidier:\r\nA-OK\r\n\r\nThe audience is seated in a circle. Four loudspeakers are located in the four corners of the space in back of the audience. The speakers will receive material from a tape-delay system.\r\n\r\nEntrances: 1. Accordionist to revolving platform in center of space. Four people will manually rotate the platform. First ring.\r\n2. Violinists enter and form second ring, faces toward audience. They do not play while waiting.\r\n3. Chorus enters and forms third ring, faces toward audience.\r\n4. Conductors enter, each with his own, a 440 (or 220) tuning fork and form fourth ring. They face center. Chief conductor signals beginning. Resonate tuning forks on floor successively.\r\n\r\nBeginning: Violinists, on cue from chief conductor, tune scordatura a e a e. Do not play anything other than necessary tuning notes. Continue to sound a's and e's. When chorus has entered (singing), begin repetitive patterns on a. Gradually add tremolo. Use single notes and/or double and triple steps. Mix in long-held\r\nnotes. After approximately ten minutes, \"hoedowns\" in A may begin. Watch for cues for your ring to make a revolution to the left or right. Chorus, on cue from chief conductor, begins to sound an a, 440 or 220. Use syllable \"Ah,\" long tones. After approximately three minutes begin chants on a, try to follow your conductor. Any abstract syllables are permissible. After approximately 15 minutes, [p.305] individual melodic lines on a are permissible. Watch for cues for your ring to make a revolution to the left or right.\r\n\r\nConductors: Continue to resonate tuning forks until the violinists are in tune. On cue from chief conductor begin to sound an a, 440 or 220 or 110. Use syllable \"Ah,\" long tones. When chief conductor introduces chorus, try to influence some of them to sing with you. After approximately three minutes, begin chants on a using abstract syllables. Influence your group. When all rings have their sound well established, the chief conductor may then try to induce his section of the audience to sing. Always keep the key of A. Watch for cues for your ring to make a revolution to the left or right.\r\nOne person in each ring is responsible for revolutions. Revolutions should start and stop and change directions during the course of the piece.\r\n\r\nAccordion: Begin to play a 440 with right hand after tuning forks are sounding. When all groups are sounding, add left hand a. Make a continuous drone. Gradually add tremolos and octave registrations. Add e's. Make accents and occasional dissonances. Try to influence tempos. Pace yourself for twenty minutes. After approximately fifteen minutes, play melodic lines in the key of A. Always continue the drone. The piece is over when the accordionist stops playing. Exits will be in reverse order on cue from the chief conductor.\r\n\r\nTape-Delay System: Suspend microphones over center for optimum pickup of accordion. Use directional microphones. After about five minutes, introduce Channel A of tape recorder 2 gradually. At seven minutes, introduce Channel B of tape recorder 2. After ten minutes, introduce Channels A and B of tape recorder 1 and the feedback loops. Avoid sudden gains or losses. Do not let playback volume exceed performers' volume. Place supply reel on tape recorder 1 (recording) and take up reel on tape recorder 2. Recorders should be about twenty-one inches apart.\r\n\r\nLighting for A-OK: The Spectrum Circle: The spectrum circle utilizes all potential light sources passing through a spectrum of colors, or as many color changes as feasible. A complete color [306] change must occur gradually (about every two minutes) through such devices as rheostats and/or color wheels.\r\nAs the tuning forks begin sounding, ordinary house-lighting (white) gradates to yellow. The entire performance area, including [307] audience, is bathed in yellow, then green, to blue to purple to red to orange to yellow to white at end of performance.\r\nAs color changes occur, reflections from tiny mirrors mounted on the accordionist's platform will revolve around the performance space, off the walls, etc.\r\nOutside the performance area, globe-shaped frosted-light sources could illuminate colors continuously running through the spectrum for the diversion of waiting visitors.\r\nOther kinds of performing groups could form new circles within the piece. I.e., a circle of children, karate, theatre, etc. Perhaps violinists could come from the famous Suzuki school. Conductors can make any kind of kinetic action to induce performers to sing. The audience is gradually included.\r\nAll or part of the sound could be piped outside to waiting visitors.\r\nThe accordionist would be yours truly. Performance time: twelve to fifteen minutes ok.",

        "text": "Terry Riley:\r\nTape-Delay Feedback System\r\n\r\nThis would be a tape system that could be used with electronic and prerecorded sound as well as with some kinds of live performance and sound sampling from within the Pavilion. The delay system could be set up in the following ways:\r\n1. A number of tape recorders (2-4) are set up in a row so that the tape can be threaded from machine to machine passing over all the heads of all the machines. The outputs from machines 2, 3, and 4 are returned to a stereo output mixer; one output from the mixer is returned to the record mode of machine 1 to feed back in combination on the same channel with the other incoming information; the other output from the mixer goes directly on to the amplification and sound-modification stages along with the output of channel 1 of the first machine.\r\n2. Instead of using all the tape recorders, it would be possible to mount a number of tape heads on a board to be placed between two tape recorders. The capstans and transports of the two machines would drive the tape across the tape heads, which are aligned to play back in ensemble with the two tape recorders. The tape heads are then fed into preamps and then into the mixer either to go directly to the amplification stages or to be fed back to tape recorder 1. With this system it is possible to get more flexibility in sound as the azimuth of the tape heads can be altered to reproduce a pure or a funky version of the original signal.\r\nEach tape head could trigger a program sequence that could correspond to the time interval between tape heads so that the information could move around the speaker matrix in cyclical patterns relating to those being set up by the tape-head series. This system could be used in conjunction with any sound program: live, electronic or prerecorded. In relation to this system, a shorter-period delay system could be very effective in creating multiple spatial echo effects.\r\nSet up five tape recorders recording at the following speeds: l5/u, 1%, 3%, 71/2 and 15 ips. Each tape recorder receives the same input source, which is also fed directly to an amplification stage. Outputs from all five tape recorders are fed to a mixer and [p.310] to five channels that can become delay periods to the original signal. By changing spatial relationships between speakers and delays, a myriad of echoes can be produced. To get periods in between the standard tape speeds, some of the recorders could be driven by oscillators or perhaps some variable-speed tape recorders could be obtained. I would use these tape-delay systems to create dense integrated networks of repeated patterns undergoing gradual change. In addition, I should like personally to perform some of my organ works designed especially for these systems. The overall sonic feeling in the dome would be one of subtle change within an essentially static framework of sound. The cost of the project would only be that of obtaining tape recorders or tape heads and preamplifiers and mixers.",

        "text": "Yoshio Tsukio\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage more active participation of the visitors, the following three types of devices are introduced. The direct expression of visitors is emphasized in real time.\r\n\r\n1. Moving Mirror (two types, two of each or more): Introduce on the floor two types of movable, cast-acrylic mirror, convex and concave, one-meter diameter, mirrorized by aluminum vacuum-plating. The focal distance of these mirrors should be equal to that of the dome (f = 7.07 meters), thus even a slight change of position will change the image abruptly. By using a half-mirror effect, not only the reflective image but the effect of light transparency can be obtained depending on the angle of vision of visitors. Mirrors would be on movable platforms and visitors could move them around. By doing so, the real-and virtual-image effects of the Mirror dome will be emphasized and played up.\r\n\r\n2. Thermo-Responsor (three or more): Several black balls coated with cholesteric liquid crystal would be hung from the ceil- ing at reachable distances for visitors. Cholesteric liquid crystal is sensitive to delicate changes of temperature in its surrounding air. It will change colors (high temperature to low temperature\u2014purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, black) denoting in real time the condition inside the dome. For instance, if the dome is crowded and temperature inside the dome rises, or if a visitor breathes upon or touches it with a hand, the color will change in response.\r\n\r\n3. Time Balloon (three types, three each or more): Prepare [p.315] chairs with built-in bellows connected by hose to balloons. Every time a visitor sits on it, the balloon swells. The balloons are of three types, adjusted to be blown full in fifteen minutes, twenty-four hours, or one month (duration of one programming period). The fifteen-minute-type and twenty-four-hour-type balloons are taken off the hose when they become full and set free to drift inside the dome space. Each day about thirty balloons will accumulate and little by little fill the dome, giving a homogeneous and continuous change to the space.",

Program using chemical change and information of voices talking: Candles are made specially, and visitors grasp them. In the wicks of the candles several kinds of chemical substances that cause changes in flame color (i.e., sodium [Na]\u2014yellow, cesium [Cs]\u2014light blue, etc.) are put at different levels, and approximately eight changes in flame color occur during ten to twelve minutes burning. The dome is set up to reflect the flame color and the direction of colorful light. In the same manner, let the number and quality of visitors be information and the programming of the sound is done only by voices talking, and the sound movement is directed.\r\n\r\n2. Program using bouncing balls: Spread mirror-film on the floor, let the whole dome become mirrorized. Bring in a silicone ball ejector. The light and sound (bouncing sound) program is controlled by silicone balls, which has high bouncing index. Visitors would participate in bouncing the balls. Bouncing gradually builds up to supersaturation condition. Simultaneously sumo wrestlers would perform on the trampoline.\r\n\r\n3. Life in the capsule and in the space: Fantastic arena of space travel is produced by light and sound. Starlight, light stream of rockets in flight. Strobe light and other auxiliary lamps can be [p.316] used to produce a space event such as the collision of shooting stars. Sound should be documentary.\r\nBy the use of dry-Ice fog, a metamorphosis of light environment is produced. Sucking of fog by vacuum cleaner. Along with light and sound effect, heterogeneous space is created.\r\nProjection of aged people on pneumatic object in midspace. Gradually, their ages retrogress and they become younger, returning to babies and to embryos in the end. The sound from the loops gradually changes over to a baby's cry.\r\nThe object in midair reveals itself entirely. It is a huge helium balloon in the shape of an embryo.\r\nBetween the legs of a giant woman object, performers and hostesses slide down a slide. Visitors would participate.\r\n\r\n4. Measuring of the Mirror dome by trampoline and Zen priests' chorus: Players\u2014students from local schools of athletics, and others, with rainbow suits on and beam-light electric torches in their hands\u2014will jump on a trampoline. The movements of their real and virtual \u00a1mages will be reflected by the Mirror and reflecting beam-lights will involve visitors to the dome in the events.\r\nIn the center of the dome space, Zen priests will sit in religious meditation (zazen) and pray together in chorus. Smells and smoke of senko (incense stick) overspread the dome space.\r\n\r\nTape Sounds\u2014(1) Number-counting in different languages (Japanese, English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and so on). Voices in various languages will be heard from each channel of speakers with variations of loudness. (2) Flowing, running, and hissing sounds (concrete sounds plus electric sounds).",

        "text": "La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, and Robert Adler\r\n\r\n1. Sound Structure: La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela propose to make a special adaptation of their major work Map of 49's Dream The Two Systems of Eleven Sets of Galactic Intervals Ornamental Lightyears Tracery. This adaptation will utilize both the dome speakers and floor handsets. Sound sources will include sine-wave oscillators tuned to intervals, triads, and chords [p.317] selected from specific categories of The Two Systems of Eleven Categories 1:07:40 AM3X 67- .\r\nSine waves have the unique characteristic among sound-wave forms of having only one frequency component. All other sound- wave forms have more than one frequency component. When a continuous frequency is sounded in an enclosed space such as a room, the air in the room is arranged into high- and low-pressure areas. In the high-pressure areas the sound is louder, and in the low-pressure areas the sound is softer. Since a sine wave has only one frequency component, the pattern of high-and low-pressure areas is easy to locate in space. Further, concurrently sounding sine waves of different frequencies will provide an environment in which the loudness of each frequency will vary audibly at different points in the room, given sufficient amplification. This phenomenon can rarely be appreciated in most musical situations, and makes the listener's position and movement in space an integral part of the sound composition.\r\nAdditionally, if small, Robert Adler helium-filled balloons can be inflated to exactly the proper pressure, they will become neutrally buoyant and may be supported by the areas of greatest variation of molecular density or air pressure of the standing waves in the dome, that is, at the points where the sound is loudest, and creates visible patterns outlining these aspects of the standing waves.\r\nThe sine waves will be produced by all thirty-seven loudspeakers, and by the handsets, in various multichannel combinations, in such a way that frequencies on each individual set will combine with those on other sets, and with a drone frequency produced by the dome loudspeakers, to produce different preferred combinations from The Two Systems of Eleven Categories depending on the proximities of the different handsets.\r\nThe lights on the handsets will be controlled, and the controls tuned to pulse on and off at frequencies which may be represented as factors related to the sine waves by powers of two. By using the higher powers of two, and gauging the length of the on-pulse, it will be possible to make certain that a bulb does not use up more than its three-minute life-span within the maximum period it will be in use. [p.318]\r\nFollowing the reflection motif already established in the mirrored dome, we will use a drone frequency at one of the simple harmonic resonances of the dome for some periods of the duration of the installation in order to obtain maximum sound reflectivity. Since The Two Systems of Eleven Categories uses only harmonically related frequencies we will determine a structure that best reinforces as many of the harmonic resonant frequencies of the dome as possible.\r\nTo realize Map of 49's Dream The Two Systems of Eleven Sets of Galactic Intervals Ornamental Lightyears Tracery, La Monte will bring his Moog synthesizer, and additional sine-wave generators and oscilloscopes. It would be helpful if the Pavilion could provide more highly stable, continuously variable-frequency sine-wave generators (with phase-lock and/or trigger-lock functions) and additional oscilloscopes, and if possible frequency counters capable of displaying ratio comparisons between two sine waves.\r\nIn addition to the sine-wave inputs, from time to time La Monte and Marian will sing live multichannel performances of sections of Map of 49's Dream The Two Systems of Eleven Sets of Galactic Intervals Ornamental Lightyears Tracery over the sine-wave drone and the harmonically related sine waves. Since Robert Adler has been chief engineer on the electronic and acoustical development of this work since the inception of The Tortoise, His Dreams and Journeys in 1964, he will be in charge of the technical setup of this aspect of the work.\r\nPrerecorded tapes of our compositions will be a third source of inputs, some of which we will also be able to sing with.",

        "text": "2. Light Structure: The two aspects which comprise the light works associated with Map of 49's Dream The Two Systems of Eleven Sets of Galactic Intervals Ornamental Lightyears Tracery will be uniquely demonstrated in the spherical Mirror dome.\r\n\r\na) The slide projections are made up of numerous black-and-white, negative and positive photographs of modular sections of several closely related designs. Each slide mount holds a photograph and a combination of colored gels. These design and color elements are combined into interlocking groups whose sequence, duration of appearance, and manipulation within the parameters [p.319] made available by the functions of the machines (i.e., focus, brilliance, color intensity) will be programmed to shift slowly in time. The machines are usually programmed in groups of three; they will be placed in triads around the perimeter of the dome and focused down onto the spectators, who will see the real images of the patterns on themselves reflected in the dome. Since the slides are symmetrical abstract designs, their real images will not appear inverted but will match the originals.\r\nAt other times the slides will be focused on the Dennis Johnson polytopic shapes and the Robert Adler balloon configurations, each of which will provide a different surface, and the possibility of other interesting effects.\r\n\r\nb) Another work exploits the inherent properties of colored light mixtures combined with specific forms to produce a fluid, variable environment which appears to contain self-luminous colored bodies freely suspended in an atmosphere of continually moving calligraphic strokes. This will be created by the deployment of floating mobile sculptures hung in symmetrical arrangements from points on the dome, and illuminated by dichroic filtered light sources at angles necessary to cast multiple colored shadows of the mobiles down onto the floor and the heads of spectators. These patterns will in turn be reflected in the dome to create real images in space.\r\nThe mobiles will be cut out of light-weight aluminum sheet, painted white, and weigh only a few ounces. The slight air currents generated by the movement of people through the Pavilion will be sufficient to keep each mobile slowly shifting around its suspension axis, creating continually moving patterns of its shadows. Some lights will also be placed below the mobiles, and the shadows will be cast onto the balloon configurations and suspended polytopes. The mobiles will reflect the lights in such a way that spectators below will see brilliantly illuminated shapes slowly changing color as the suspended form moves and reflects a different dichroic source.\r\nDichroic filters can be obtained for three hundred-watt quartz spotlights, which will produce very intense, near-pure colors. They can be mounted about the perimeter of the floor area of the [p.320] dome and fixed in position so that only the on-off function need be controlled from the booth.\r\n\r\nc) A third proposal for the lights provides a method for color-cod- ing the transitions of groups of people through the Pavilion. An estimate must be made of the maximum number of people who will go through the Pavilion each fifteen minutes. Each time the handset is returned to the entrance gate, the bulb color (or a plastic filter clipped onto a flashlight) is changed.\r\nThus, the gradual shift in colors will indicate the time it takes people to visit the Pavilion. A natural flow of color sequences will appear and be reflected in the dome. The color shift may even place a kind of psychological pressure on people to move on as they begin to notice they have the only turquoise light in a sea of blues. A possible color sequence would follow the spectral order, i.e., red, orange, yellow, yellow-green, green, turquoise, blue, violet. Probably eight different colors would be sufficient to cover the maximum time periods anyone might spend in the Pavilion, so that after two hours the color sequence would begin again.",

Charlip had made up several large squares of bright-colored, very thin China silk, which the participants in his program (in this case, EAT. wives, girl friends, and female staff members) held by the corners and lifted, so as to make them billow and float. The reflections were colorful, but Martin and several others felt that they did not exploit the Mirror's extraordinary properties to best advantage. For the sound accompaniment to his piece (which he had decided to call Homage to Loie Fuller), Charlip had made a tape recording of his own breathing. Amplified over thirty-seven loudspeakers that were mounted in a rhomboid grid behind the mirror walls, it sounded very much like a man breathing into a tape recorder.\r\nWhile Charlip rehearsed, the engineers continued to work on the sound system.",

Transition from one section to the next will be instantaneous and dramatic.\r\n\r\nA poet will write a description, both artistic and technical, about what is taking place. This will be heard over the loop system, e.g. \"It is now Spring ... streams full from melting snows ...\" The sound of water gurgling and rushing will come over the sound system. To create the impression of actual passage of water, different speakers will transmit different water sounds.\r\nTechnical information on how this is done will be given over the loop-system.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM OUTLINE\r\n\r\n1. Spring : Remy Charlip. The dome is green. Sounds of water rushing, birds, rain.\r\n2. Summer: Alan Kaprow. The dome is golden. Sounds of the beach, children playing, farm machinery.\r\n3. Autumn: Jerome Robbins. The dome is red/russet. Sounds of birds migrating, wild geese, a harvest festival.\r\n4. Winter: La Monte Young. The dome is blue-white. Sounds of cold winds, breaking ice.\r\n5. Earth : John Hassell, sound-modification composer. Sounds of earthquakes, an avalanche, body-sounds, heartbeats.\r\n6. Air: Terry Riley, wind-instruments composer. Sounds of air, wind, jet-plane.\r\n7. Fire: Ann Halprin. Temperamental violence. Sounds of fire. Flames in the dome.\r\n8. Water: Whale People. The dome is blue/green - dim, under-water. Sounds of water dripping, songs of whales.",

Owens, clinging for an hour to 8 rope ladder suspended through the winch-light opening, had patched the rip in the Mirror. The balloon was tight again, and was casting real and virtual images in profusion. The presence of a large number of people in the Mirror dome added a new element of animation, which greatly pleased Whitman and Breer. Half a dozen hostesses in bright-red maxicoats and red cloches had been stationed at intervals around the perimeter, and their reflections lent a festive note to the scene. The trouble was that very few of the visitors ever looked up into the Mirror. Handsets held to one ear, they walked around looking down at the variously textured floor sections, or else they watched the E.A.T. girls playing with Charlip's silk scarves.",

Announcement over handsets saying that the world, especially as demonstrated in the Pavilion, is full of incredible sounds, many of which the listener has just heard; now we introduce a group of sounds that can be heard and experienced nowhere in the world outside the Pavilion. Before now these sounds have only been heard by whales at sea.\r\n\r\n2. Sound: Pure sea, open ocean, immersion sound.\r\nLights: White, quite bright, \u00a1mage projected onto floor simulating the shimmer of light on water as seen from just below the surface; this is achieved by projecting light through clear container of agitated water.\r\n\r\n3. Sound: Point sound, singing whale approaching gradually. Line sound possible, used to indicate slight variations in position of whale as he approaches more or less directly. Pure ocean sounds continue on all other speakers except the speakers where individual whales are introduced.\r\nLights: Begin gradual dimming, which should continue until darkness is very deep, about three-quarters through total whale program.\r\n\r\n4. Sound: Second singing whale is introduced moving in a distant arc, then gradually moving closer.\r\n\r\n5. Lights: Slightly before dome reaches maximum darkness, random flickering of hand-set lights begins. Individuals may conceive of having completed a descent in the ocean to the point known as the deep-scattering layer, which is inhabited by luminescent fish.\r\n\r\n6. Sound: Use of line and point sound to simulate the following activities: whales swimming closer and closer, singing to each other; one of the whales arrives in the area first. By moving sound rapidly to top of dome, the leap of a humpback whale can be experienced. Sound is cut off suddenly at topmost speaker, followed by two to three seconds of open ocean immersion sound. The jump is concluded when massive tape-recorded sounds of whale reimmersing are splashed over topmost speakers. The first whale, having completed his leap, moves gradually away from the [p.394] area. The second whale moves closer and closer until his song is heard as a very loud total-immersion sound. After four to five seconds, the whale begins to depart from this area.\r\n\r\n7. Sound: Aurally documents ascent.\r\nLights: As the second whale is departing, lights are programmed in reverse of the order described above so that a relatively rapid ascent through the water is simulated.\r\n\r\n8. Program is completed when light and sea sounds simulate a return to the level just below the ocean's surface.",

        "text": "One of the first special projects was part of \"Contemporary Voices in the Arts,\" a series of performances on college campuses upstate New York sponsored by the New York State Council on the Arts. The project concluded the series in New York City at the YM/YWHA on Ninety-second Street and Lexington Avenue, February 25, 1967. Called \"Homage to E.A.T.\" or \"TV Banner,\" it was an electronically amplified television dinner and panel discussion. The discussion at the dinner table included John Cage, Bobert Creeley, Merce Cunningham, Billy Kl\u00fcver, Len Lye, Jack Tworkov, and Stan VanDerBeek. Sound switching, television projection, proportional control of projectors, and other technical elements were the work of Per Biorn, Ralph Flynn, Jim HcGee, Jim McGee, Jr., Leonard Bobinson, Bruce Robinson, Fred Waldhauer, and Dick Wolff.\r\nA friend of E.A.T. at one of E.A.T.'s board meetings later said he had heard poor reviews of the event and cautioned E.A.T. to be careful of the caliber of their programs or they might be out of business before being established. (*)\r\nSeveral persons recall that the event did bring together artists and engineers, which was new for some, but did not have anything new otherwise, technically or aesthetically. There were many technical difficulties with the equipment, which did not seem to bother some of the engineers. Some of the artists wondered why it didn't and why these difficulties had arisen since they had been successfully doing similar things by themselves in the past. When a projection screen happened to fall on the audience, as Jim McGee recalls, the angry audience stood up to yell and throw coins on stage until captured by John Cage (*). Cage had proceeded to play his \"fish,\" a suspended piece of metal rapped to give unusual sounds, for which he received a standing ovation.\r\n\r\n(*) Minutes of E.A.T.'s board meeting at Robert Rauschenberg's place, March 6, 1967.\r\n(*) Telephone interview, December 4, 1973.",

        "text": "A.1. MATCHINGS\r\nMatching procedures are currently being revised. The new matching procedure will be as follows: You will be sent the names, addresses, and occupations of up to three technical persons in your immediate area (unless you state that you are prepared to collaborate by mail if there is no one nearby). In some cases only one technical person may be available, or none at all, in which case the project will be kept on an open file and you will be notified.\r\nHopefully one of the technical persons will be able to collaborate with you. Contact them in your order of preference and discuss the possibilities of collaboration. The technical persons will not be notified about the project, so there is no need to contact the second or third if the first one leads to a working collaboration.\r\nAfter making contact, could you mail back the E.A.T. Collaboration Information cards (an example is enclosed). This is the only way we can know whether or not a collaboration is taking place, and whether the technical persons whose names were sent are subsequently preoccupied with a collaboration or free to be introduced to someone else.\r\nIf, in the past, you submitted a proposal which was not matched, could you let us know whether it is still viable. If not, could you use the enclosed project proposal form either to describe it in its new form, or to describe any new project you might wish to submit for collaboration.",

        "text": "Local Report is the latest in a series of communication media works that Robert Whitman has produced since 1972.\r\n\r\nThe basic structure of these works was for 30 people assigned to different parts of the city or calling area to call at five minute intervals and describe something they saw at the moment; these reports were then broadcast live. Whitman put the incoming calls directly on the air as they came in, his only intervention being to end the call when, as he puts it, \u201cThe caller has produced a coherent image.\u201d Ninety calls over a thirty minute period produced the final work. The news reports capture the nature of a specific place and time, revealing it to audience and participants alike.\r\n\r\nThe first performance of this work was titled NEWS and took the form of a live broadcast program in New York City in which participants called in from pay phones; their reports were broadcast live over radio station WBAI. NEWS was performed in Houston, Texas, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and other cities over a two to three year period. Whitman remembers that when he first performed the piece, \u201cPay phones cost a dime.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn subsequent performances of this work, Whitman used the latest technology available. In 2002 he worked with cell phones in Leeds, England; the cell phone calls were broadcast in real time on large speakers in a public square in the town. A recording of the resulting sound composition was made available by the sponsor, Lumens, on the internet at UBUweb.\r\n\r\nNow in 2005, Whitman continues to explore the newest communication technology: The participants will use camera cell phones to transmit voice and video reports to the central performance site, where information will be played and projected. The reports will be simultaneously streamed live over this website.\r\n\r\nWhile the technology has changed, what has remained constant in these works is that Whitman gets to know the area of the performance and works with local people in each location who know and love their town or area . Whitman uses their reports and descriptions to record and reveal the special nature of each place. Whitman creates with sound--and now with sound and images--a cultural map of a unique locality. Transformed by art, the local becomes universal.\r\n\r\nLocal Report is being performed in the summer of 2005 in available spaces at five shopping centers in the Northeastern United States. The legacy and promise of the project is to demonstrate not only the possibility of using such public spaces as venues for cultural events and programs, but also that the project can be replicated, that projects can be organized in which individuals -- from school children on up -- can get involved in seeing, describing and ultimately enjoying their own environments in new and more pleasurable ways.\r\n\r\nHow to run your own Local Report",

        "text": "How to create your own Local Report\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n\r\nIt is very much possible for anyone to run their own Local Report, and it does not take a large scale production in order to make it work. Give time, patience, and resourcefulness, a moderately tech-savvy producer could draw on the resources given here and set up the infrastructure for running Local Reports themselves. At a minimum, running a Local Report requires an internet connection, Voice-over-IP service, a decently capable computer and collaborators with video capable mobile phones (to be reporters). Running the Local Reports as documented in this book required a relatively complicated computer setup since there were many facets to the production. If you want to run your own Local Report, you need not include every aspect of the production in order to have a successful Local Report. For example, your Local Report could be played live on a screen and speakers, then recorded and posted to the website later. In that case, you would not need to set up the streaming infrastructure. Or, you could have the event only displayed live via streaming, in which case you would not need local playback and recording capabilities.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\r\nThe Whitman Local Report was run at 5 locations over the course of 2 months. At each location we had an internet connection, several laptops, a projector and of course 30 \"reporters\" with mobile phones. The reporters were sent out into the local area with the task of recording video in 20 second snippets which were sent back to the Local Report head-quarters and calling in live with a verbal report as well. At the head-quarters we sequenced the video as it came in and played the audio live when the caller called. We projected this all and played the audio on large speakers for anyone to come and watch. We also streamed it out onto the internet live so anyone anywhere could watch.\r\n\r\nBelow is a breakdown of the individual pieces that comprised the project presented with the intent to help you produce your own version of the Local Report.\r\n\r\nMobile phones:\r\n\r\nFor the Whitman Local Report (WLR) we used 30 Nokia 7610 phones. These phones support development using Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) and have additional capabilities for video and networking (MIDP 2.0 and MMAPI). Now-a-days these capabilities are common on many handsets and the application that was developed for WLR could be ported to a variety of other models. The basic requirements are a video camera, support for J2ME (with MIDP 2.0 and MMAPI) with video capture.\r\n\r\nThe source code for the WLR phone application is available online at: http://www.whitmanlocalreport.net/phone/source/\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in giving it a try before attempting to modify the source, the compiled application can be downloaded directly to your phone and tested by going to the following URL: http://www.whitmanlocalreport.net/phone/Whitman_Mobile_Video.jar\r\n\r\nThere is one caveat to trying this application out, it is that the sending of the video to the Local Report server requires a data connection through your mobile phone service provider (T-Mobile, Cingular, Verizon..) and use of this data connection might cost you extra depending on your service. You should check these costs before attempting to use the application.\r\n\r\nThe source for the application can be able to be compiled and installed as is but unless you make some minor modifications, it will upload the video to the Whitman Local Report Server instead of where you might want it to go. The upload URL (HTTP POST) is hard coded into the source.\r\n\r\nTo change the upload location in the Java source you will need to modify the following line in the WhitmanMVideo.java file and input the correct URL in place of the www.whitmanlocalreport.net/phone/up.php URL: HTTPPoster poster = new HTTPPoster(\"http://www.whitmanlocalreport.net/phone/up.php\", \"post.3gp\", videoBytes);\r\n\r\nIf you try the application out without modifying the source, you should be able to find the video you upload by going to: http://www.whitmanlocalreport.net/videos/\r\n\r\nLast, this application has a couple of features/bugs/items on the to do list. We welcome any modifications or contributions back to the source should you be interested in helping out. Ok, here is the list:\r\n\r\n1: The status indication for uploads does not accurately indicate the progress of the file upload. This is unfortunately a limitation in the Java platform on mobile devices.\r\n\r\n2: The videos are not saved on the device. There is an attempt to utilize a \"record store\" to do such but it's implementation is not complete and does not function correctly.\r\n\r\nAgain with the caveat, this application requires the use of a data connection on the phone from your mobile provider. If you do not have a plan to encompasses data use you will generally be paying a premium for the service. Second, video files are generally fairly large and can eat up your allowed data usage. In other words, BE CAREFUL with how you use this until you know what it will cost.\r\n\r\nVideo Reception:\r\n\r\nThe mobile phone application uses HTTP file upload capabilities to send the video to a web server on the internet. The following very basic (and very insecure) PHP script can be used to receive the video files sent from the phone:\r\n\r\n<? $uploadfilename = time() . \"_\" . rand(1000,9999) . \"_\" . basename($_FILES['bytes']['name']); $uploaddir = '/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx/videos/'; $uploadfile = $uploaddir . $uploadfilename; if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['bytes']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile)) { echo \"Video Sent!\"; } else { echo \"Error: Video Not Sent!\"; } ?>\r\n\r\nIn order to use the above script, you should put the code in a text file with the extension \".php\". You should also change the line that starts with \"$uploaddir\" to point to the location you want the video files saved on your server. You will need a webserver that can run PHP scripts and this script will have to be placed somewhere that is web accessible (you probably want it in location that you are pointing to with the mobile phone application).\r\n\r\nVideo Playback Application:\r\n\r\nOnsite at each location we had a laptop hooked up to a projector that ran an application to play back the videos full screen as they came in from the server. This application is actually two applications, the first is called \"rsync\", which is an application for synchronizing files across a network. Rsync was running on the server as a \"daemon\", meaning it was running as a service in the background. It was configured to share the videos read-only to any connection, so that we did not need to set passwords, but didn't have to worry about someone deleting or moving the files. Rsync then also ran on the video playback laptop to download the incoming videos from the server. It was set to run using \"cron\", an scheduling service which ran the rsync program every few minutes to download any new videos.\r\n\r\nThe second portion is a Java application that uses QuickTime for Java (which is bundled with QuickTime and iTunes) to playback the videos in sequence with controls for playing the next and previous videos. This application only plays 3gp videos but can be modified to play other QuickTime compatible formats fairly easily.\r\n\r\nThe source for this application can be downloaded here: http://www.whitmanlocalreport.net/video_player/\r\n\r\nOn-site Computer Setup:\r\n\r\nAt each location, we had an internet connection set up and ready to go when we got there. We then set up a small network of computers to run the show. One laptop was dedicated to managing the incoming calls and playing the audio from those calls. The next laptop was used for downloading the videos from the server playing them back. Both the audio and video were sent to another laptop that combined them into a stream and sent it to the streaming server. The audio/video signal was also sent to a local projector and PA system for live playback on-site.\r\n\r\nServer Setup:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the collection of laptops that was used on-site, there was one remote server. The server, running the Debian operating system, was located at a colocation facility in Los Angeles. It provided a number of essential functions: website hosting with the Apache web server; phone call termination and call queue system using Asterisk phone system software; custom software for receiving videos send from the phones and relaying them to the laptops on location; and, the public streaming server, running Darwin Streaming Server, that delivered the audio/video stream for the world to experience.\r\n\r\nPhone System (PBX/Asterisk):\r\n\r\nThe central part of the voice reports is the phone system built using Asterisk. It is essentially a call queue system like any business might have when you call their customer service number. Participants dial one of the phone numbers pre-programmed into the mobile phones. Asterisk answers, plays back some basic instructions, then moves on to the hold music, announcing the caller's position in the queue whenever the a call was answered. The first caller in the queue is transferred to the extension of the software phone running on the laptop on location. This software phone acts just like a phone in an office phone system does, it has an extension number that works only within that context. When the participant is next in the queue, Asterisk played them a prompt to get them prepared to deliver their report: \"Get ready, your next! When the hold music stops you are live on the air!\". After the current call is hung up, the next participant is prompted, asterisk sends the next call to the software phone on location. The software phone was configured to automatically answer as soon as possible, putting the audio immediately on the air. When the current report hits a good breaking point, hit the Esc key on the laptop running the software phone. Then the call is dropped and the next one picked up, starting this process again.\r\n\r\nTo setup your own queue system you will need an Asterisk server (http://www.asterisk.org) and Voice over IP (VoIP) service. You can find lots of help for setting up Asterisk help online, so this is just an outline of what needs doing. It is probably worthwhile to get a hosting provider to install and host Asterisk for you. Once you have Asterisk running and receiving calls from normal phones (mobile or otherwise), you can setup the call queue mechanism. All of the queues are set up in a file called \"queues.conf\". In this file you can set up the various automated announcements, the frequency of the announcements, and which extension receives the calls from the queue. All in all, the Local Report setup only required about 10 custom settings to get the call queue working.\r\n\r\nNext, you will need to have a piece of software called a \"soft-phone\" to receive the calls as they come in. For this purpose we used software called Freshtel Firefly, but there are many solid options available now, depending on which operating system your computer is running. Essentially this software works just like a phone, receiving calls using VoIP instead of a normal phone line. We hooked this phone into Asterisk to be the phone that Asterisk directed the calls to once they were in the top of the queue. Again, the setup of this is out of the scope of this document but plenty of information for configuring soft-phones to work with Asterisk can be found online.\r\n\r\nLast, Asterisk might be one of those portions of the system that we used for our setup that might be overkill for what you want to do. Many VoIP TSP (Telephony Service Providers) allow you to configure service with them to work directly with a soft-phone. Some might even allow you to setup a queue. We used Voicepulse for our service, they come highly recommended but the industry is changing quickly and it would behoove you to shop around a bit.\r\n\r\nMobile Phone Configuration:\r\n\r\nThe mobile phones that we used were configured so that they would be as easy to use as possible. We wanted to make it possible to have people with no mobile phone experience be able to fully participate in Local Report. Much of this configuration was centered around making the user need as few button clicks as possible in order to make their reports. In particular, we configured the two \"soft keys\" to open the two relevant applications for Local Report: the video application and the contacts (for calling in).\r\n\r\nWhen a participant clicked on the soft key to launch the video application, the user needed only to keep clicking on that same soft key in order to choose all of the requisite options in order to record a video and upload it to the server. The first click launched the application, the second click started recording video, the third click stopped the recording, then the remaining clicks uploaded the video. When a participant clicked on the audio soft key, they were presented with four different phone numbers to dial, all of which dial the same phone system. The participant just clicked once more to dial a number, then followed the voice prompts of the phone system to do their audio report.\r\n\r\nMaking a Video Report:\r\n\r\nFirst, the participant launched the video application as described above. This would open a preview window which they could use to set up the shot. Following that, a press to video soft key (the left button) started recording. Once recording started, the border around the video preview turned red, and a countdown from 20 starts, showing the remaining recording time. The participant could compose the video however they want to within the 20 second limit. When the countdown hit zero, the participant was prompted to upload the video, which was done by a couple clicks on the video soft key (allowing the application to access the network). Once the video uploaded was complete, the participant was notified on the phone, and the video was automatically played on-site and on the stream.\r\n\r\nMaking an Audio Report:\r\n\r\nThe Asterisk phone system answered the call, played a pre-recorded welcome, then placed the call in a hold queue, complete with hold music. As the call advanced in the queue, the phone system announced the call's position in the queue. When the call was up next, the participant heard a little pep talk, getting them ready to deliver their report. When the call was finally answered, the hold music stopped and the participant was immediately speaking live on location and the stream.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThere are indeed many parts that make up the whole system that runs a Local Report, but each of the pieces is actually relatively simple in the grand scheme of things. Fortunately, there is a lot of good, free software like Asterisk, rsync, and J2ME that this whole system is built upon. Using the software that are provided on the whitmanlocalreport.net website, your own Local Report is that much closer to happening.",

While encapsulating the germination of ideas which later proved to be fundamental in Bochner\u2019s extremely influential work since the late 1960's, the Singer Notes have been generally unknown.\r\nIn 1968, Bochner replied to an open call organised by the already renowned \u201cExperiments in Art and Technology\u201d program. (Robert Rauschenberg and Billy Kl\u00fcver initiated E.A.T. in 1966, when scientific optimism within American culture was at its climax.) Bochner was selected to partake in a residency at the Singer Laboratories in New Jersey. Between September and December 1968, he was to visit the labs three times a week. The Singer Notes are made up of notes and drawings which resulted from the conversations he held with scientists and engineers there. \r\nAlthough, in his application letter, the artist expressed his interest in a computerised \u201cnumerical photographic translation\u201d, the residency actually consisted mainly of conversations and dialogical speculation. It was inspiring and instructive but Bochner remained sceptical with regards to the scientists\u2019 positivist predicates. The Singer Notes, which were the primary outcome of such conversations, tackle several themes: how do scientists translate their research into more concrete applications? how do they design experiments? the nature of colour as a type of energy; the fundamental differences between the analog and the digital; how do scientists (and in a broader sense, people) know what they know? \r\nIt was in this context that Bochner furthered his interest for intellectual research that he had developed as of 1964, while studying philosophy at Northwestern University in New York, reading the theories of Wittgenstein, Sartre and Heidegger. During the residency, his lack of a preconceived plan and his strong critical view on positivism led Bochner to formulate ideas for new works, as well as for projects which were to exist only conceptually. For example, texts written in the snow with heat-sensitive ink that would only be visible at a certain temperature then would disappear; or images created purely from algorithms, with no preliminary manmade drawings. The Singer Notes end on the first utterances of certain speculations which will later become one of Bochner\u2019s most important works, the Measurement Series. \r\nWhile many of Mel Bochner\u2019s works are included as iconic moments in the narrative of American postwar art, the Singer Notes haven\u2019t seen the light of day for over fifty years. They have never been exhibited nor have they ever been published until now.\r\nDuring a discussion with S\u00e9bastien Pluot in 2013, the artist spoke about this work. They then decided to record a further conversation as they looked through each page of notes. It is this transcription which is included in the second half of the recent Singer Notes, 1968 publication, while the first half of said publication comprises an exact copy of the Singer Notes themselves.\r\nIt was in 2015 that Mel Bochner and S\u00e9bastien Pluot proposed to Mich\u00e8le Didier to publish the entirety of the Singer Notes alongside the conversation between Bochner and Pluot. They also suggested an exhibition, taking one of the last drawings of the Singer Notes as its starting point.\r\nIn the first room of the gallery, a facsimile of the original Singer Notes binder* is placed upon a pedestal, thus harking back to Bochner\u2019s display of his historical 1966 piece entitled Working Drawings And Other Visible Things on Paper Not Necessarily Meant To Be Viewed as Art. This facsimile, published in three copies, is produced by mfc-mich\u00e8le didier on the occasion of the exhibition.\r\nIn the second room, the artist installs Measurement Perimeter, this first Measurement Room, which has never been exhibited. A major work, which can be seen as the culmination of the experiments and research undertaken at Singer Labs.\r\nThis hitherto unseen exhibition will be shown for the first time in Paris at mfc-mich\u00e8le didier gallery from september 8 to November 10, 2017. \r\n*\u200aMEL BOCHNER\r\n\u200a\u200aSinger Notes - (Binder)\r\nAluminium Binder.\r\nDimensions of the Binder: 303 x 291 x 70 mm.\r\nContains 47 looseleaves slipped in plastic folds.\r\nDimensions of the plastic folds: 280 \u00d7 215 mm.\r\nPrinted on Lessebo Design Natural 120 g.\r\nLimited edition of 3 numbered and signed copies.\r\nProduced and published in 2017 by mfc-mich\u00e8le didier.",

        "text": "Mel Bochner |  Singer Notes is a group of notes, sketches and diagrams that were collected into a book. But they didn't begin that way. In the late sixties Bob Rauschenberg and Billy Kl\u00fcver started a group called E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology). Kl\u00fcver was an engineer who worked at Bell Laboratories and had come up with the idea of working and doing projects with artists, mostly with Rauschenberg at that point. It's a long story but eventually Kl\u00fcver left Bell Labs. He and Rauschenberg started their own collaborative project, E.A.T. that was in the optimistic spirit of the time, and guided by Rauschenberg's extraordinary generosity. Bob didn't monopolized the project for himself, but shared it with other artists, opening the possibilities of technology to a whole generation. There was the famous E.A.T. 9 Evenings as well as many smaller projects which E.A.T. either raised money to fund or collaborated on with others.\r\nBy the late sixties Singer Labs was engaged with a lot of different activities, many of them were very high-tech - research for the Government involving computers and other advanced technological stuff. Someone at Singer had the idea that they would like to have an artist working with them too. (Perhaps because they were in competition with Bell Labs, also located in New Jersey.) So they solicited E.A.T. with a proposition for an artist to work at Singer. A number of artist were invited to submit a proposal and - to make a long story short - mine was chosen.\r\nI travelled out to Denville, New Jersey, three days a week, about an hour on the bus, and met with a rotating group of engineers, mathematicians and physicists. We sat around and talked all day; it was like a think tank. There was no set agenda, we talked about things that people were working on and essentially tried to find some kind of common ground. In other words, it began as a conversation to find something to have a conversation about, which had a nice circular logic to it.\r\nS\u00e9bastien Pluot | Did this \"circular logic\" define the project that you wanted to do? Other artists seemed to be making more technical partnerships.\r\nMB | Yes, most of the other artists who applied needed technical assistance for a precise physical artwork. Although I didn't have any specific project in mind, I did go in with one idea, that somehow through manipulating numbers, as I had done in drawings, the computer could translate them into photographic images. But the programmers said it would take longer to write the program than it would for me to do it by hand. So that idea went nowhere.\r\nSB | In the project you submitted to E.A.T. you are talking about \"numerical photographic translations.\"\r\nMB | 1968 was still the early days of computers. They were almost impossible to get access to, but I thought it might somehow be possible to use them in my work. At that time computers were not \"user friendly,\" you had to be able to translate everything into the computer's language, Fortran, in order to make it do anything. The lab had very powerful machines that were the size of a room. Although they seemed very fast, they were painfully slow compared to computer today. [...]",

        "text": "HANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 I interviewed Billy Kluver a few years ago for the same series of interviews, and speaking about experiments in art and technology, he mentioned your \"Singer Project\" which is very much related to what John Latham in England set up, the Artists Placement Group. Kluver had a similar project in which people were invited for residencies. I wondered if you could tell me a little about your experience with EAT in this \"Singer\" lab. I imagine there must be a lot of realized and unrealized issues because \"The Measurement\" series grew out of this, it was one of the things that was triggered by it, but at the same time there were a lot of unrealized projects in this context. \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER:\u2028 The \"Singer Project\" proved to be important to me, for a number of reasons. But I had two requirements before I accepted the project, because I didn't want to be there as a \"tourist.\" I wanted to be there on exactly the same terms as the scientists, so I demanded a salary - whatever the average salary was for a research scientist. I knew it was the only way to be taken seriously. My second requirement e was an office, so I was physically part of that situation. \r\n\u2028HANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 You were infiltrating. \u2028\r\nMEL BOCHNER:\u2028 You could see in those terms. The daily process was quite simple; we sat around a table drinking coffee, and talking. I talked about the things I was thinking about and the things that I wanted to do, and they did the same. One of my projects was to feed numbers into the computer and the computers would generate permutations of those numbers which would be printed out as photographs. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 That must have been a very early moment of digital photography, that's incredible. \u2028\r\nMEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Unfortunately a bit too early, because they didn't have the technology to do it. The programmer told me, 'do you know what, you can make these faster by hand than I can' because, in 1968, he couldn't write a complex enough program. At that time you had to translate everything into FORTRAN. That sort of washed out the one project I had intended to do there. So after that we sat around for three months just talking. \r\n\u2028HANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 Coffee breaks! \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Basically a day-long coffee break. But this is what they did for a living, what they did every day. It was research and development, brainstorming new things for the company to produce, sitting around the table, scribbling notes to themselves. So, right from the very first day, I started saving every scrap of paper. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 And has that been published? \u2028\r\nMEL BOCHNER: \u2028I made a Xerox edition of two, which I called \"The Singer Notes.\" \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 So it remains kind of unpublished. \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Yes. What was exciting was that the conversation roamed all over the place. One scientist was very interested in color theory. So we started designing a motorized three-dimensional color model. It never got built, but it led to some interesting conversations about the chemistry of color. They told me about some dyes that had recently been invented that were temperature sensitive. Only at certain temperatures would you be able to see them. One project I came up with was to draw or write things in a landscape using dyes that you could only see when it was very cold. Suddenly when the temperature fell below 32F, a message would come out of the ground. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST: \u2028A form of public art which according to the weather would be... \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER: \u2028Invisible. Anyway, many of the ideas weren't meant to be realized, they were pure speculation, meant to provoke the conversation, because it was clear to me that the conversation themselves were \"the project.\" The conversations often centered around the idea of objectification - how can we find a common language, and that invariably came down to some form of measurement. It was about how experience can be communicated, and at the same time, the fallibility of every measurement system. \u2028HANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028No absolute. \u2028\r\nMEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Exactly and that's where perception came into the equation. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 Perhaps there are some connections with Merleau Ponty? \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER:\u2028 In a way, very close to his ideas. The first measurement piece that I did was for the sake of the conversation. I secretly went around the laboratory measuring things, marking dimensions on the walls and floors with letraset numbers. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 That was an intervention directly into the science lab? \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Yes. For example, I measured the distance from a spray can to the end of the wall. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 And so if the can is removed it leads to disorder! \u2028\r\nMEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Or if the door is closed the signifier disappears. I had photographs taken of these interventions and when I looked at the photographs the interesting thing was that there was no way to know the actual size of the object in the photograph. So I next drew twelve inches on the wall and photographed myself against it, then gave the negative to the printer and asked him to print it so that the measurement in the print would be exactly twelve inches, or actual size. By doing that the photograph became the index of the index, or a vicious circle. That, for me, was the end of photography. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 So the time of your residency at the Singer lab was not only the beginning of \"The Measurements\" but also the moment of the end of photography for you. \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Yes. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST: \u2028When I interviewed Billy Kluver, it struck me that rather than discussions around round tables about interdisciplinarity, bringing practitioners together in a very pragmatic sense with a concrete project is a truly visionary model. Do you think this is the case? \r\n\u2028MEL BOCHNER:\u2028 Yes, I do. The EAT project was visionary also in terms of the openness and generosity of it. Rauschenberg and Kluver made so much time and energy available for other artists, I can't think of anything else that's been like that. EAT was unique because it wasn't ideological in any sense - that in itself was pretty radical in the sixties. \u2028\r\nHANS ULRICH OBRIST:\u2028 And transgenerational too. Before we were talking about misunderstandings, (and I was curious about this in relation to science and engineering) there can sometimes be productive misunderstandings, and this was just at the moment that you made the amazing work entitled Misunderstandings. Could you talk a little about these issues and this work? ",

        "text": "Moon Museum: The Story of a Tiny Space Object\r\nForrest Myers had been dreaming about Space since the Russian launch of Sputnik. As a young sculptor, he was influenced by the work of Alexander Calder. As Myers recalls [1]: \u201cAs an artist considering Calder, I was thinking about the unique possibilities of a zero-gravity environment\u201d. He continues: \u201cThe first Moon landing was like the salamander crawling out of the soup\u201d. From Myers\u2019 perpective, Darwinian evolution seemed to happen in fossil time, but seeing Man leave the Earth and step foot on the Moon was both instant and epic. It lead him to propose sending art to the Moon \u2013 his art and the art of others he admired.\r\nWhile working on the Pepsi Pavilion for the Osaka Fair with numerous artists and engineers, all associated with Experiments in Art and Technology, Myers pitched his idea to E.A.T. founders Dr. Billy Kl\u00fcver and Fred D. Waldhauer who responded with strong support.\r\nIn the tradition of the Bo\u00eete-en-valise \u2013 or \u201cbox in a suitcase\u201d, the miniature monographic \u201ctraveling museum\u201d that Marcel Duchamp assembled between 1935-41, and the \u201cLegitimate Gallery\u201d that Robert Filliou conceived in his hat in 1962, the Moon Museum was both portable and unconventional. Measuring a mere 9/16 x 3/4 x 1/32 inches, it reproduced a unique cache of drawings through lithographic means on an Alumina ceramic wafer (like a computer microchip) with Tantalum as \u201ccolor\u201d on a Tantalum nitride surface. It was manufactured at Bell Telephone Laboratories by Fred D. Waldhauer and Robert N. Merkle whose expertise was computer circuitry, a cutting edge technology at the time. As a former assistant [2] to Waldhauer recalled in 2005: \u201cA number of us worked to photographically reduce the original artists\u2019 drawings onto ceramic tiles. Our area of expertise at the Labs was high speed thin film technology\u201d. The total number of copies remains uncertain: as many as forty seems to have been produced, but reports are contradictory and far fewer have actually been located.\r\n[...]\r\nMoon Museum: An Artwork Composed of Six Artworks\r\nMyers later remarked that contributors were all quite serious about the project. Although Claes Oldenburg sending a cartoon to the Moon may seem a little absurd, his Geometric Mouse Kite drawing was related to a large-scale sculpture now in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cFrom Mickey Mouse, he created his own iconic, artistic interpretation\u201d says Myers. Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s \u201cline\u201d drawing or Warhol\u2019s \u201cAW\u201d penis sketch [4] could appear casual, but, in context, the artist\u2019s initials and the line seem about basic mark-making. Like Neil Armstrong\u2019s boot impressions on the lunar surface, both can be interpreted as the conceptual footprint of an artist.\r\nThe contributions of David Novros and John Chamberlain were related to their paintings at that time. As David Novros recalled [5]: \u201cI made similar diagrammatic instruction drawings for the guys commissioned to make the stretcher bars necessary for my large-scale paintings. I was firmly against drawing as an expression of touch or verisimilitude. Drawing was a way of thinking about these big paintings I wanted to make.\u201dThe white lines in the Novros drawing were the spaces that separated the panels in his large-scale, architectural works. Whereas, Chamberlain\u2019s composition echoes the template he was using to candy-apple spray (with an automobile finish) grids on small square panels.\r\nMyers\u2019 own drawing was related to a preexisting sculpture. Invited to a group exhibition at MIT, he showed a large, deceptively simple metal work. At first glance, it appears to be aligned geometric forms, but, upon closer inspection, the forms are interlocking and derived from a continuous line. According to Myers, he was then approached by several MIT professors. \u201cThey confessed that my work was a precise physical manifestation of a computer rendering they had spent the entire semester plotting\u201d. Much to Myers surprise, they were able to take his sculptural form and manipulate it in virtual space. He says: \u201cThe \u2018computer drawing\u2019 I included on the Moon Museum was, in fact, a screen-capture taken with a Polaroid camera\u201d. Rendered on a computer, Myers drawing is a 2-dimensional representation of a sculptural form that was plotted in virtual space.\r\n1. Quotations from Myers are from the two interviews conducted by Jade Dellinger with the artist in March 28 and May 13, 2009.\r\n2. Declining to be named, in a private email correspondence with Jade Dellinger.\r\n[...]\r\n4. Hidden on the picture reproduced in the New York Times of November 22, 1969 and emphasized as being his \u201ccalligraphic squiggle made up of the initials of his signature\u201d.\r\n5.

        "text": "Ever since the first sputnik orbited, a New York sculptor named Forrest Myers has yearned to plant a work of art on the moon.\r\nNow he believes he has done it, via the Apollo 12 mission. It takes the form of a tiny ceramic wafer bearing drawings by six New York artists that is said to have been clandestinely affixed to a leg of the lunar module Intrepid.\r\nBut an official of the space agency is not so sure. He said yesterday that he knew nothing about the purported project.\r\nAccording to Mr. Myers, the effort came about this way: Some months ago, the sculptor, who has recently been working with light beams and other \" technological media, asked some artists for drawings to send to the moon. Five of his friends obliged: Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, David Novros and John Chamberlain. Mr. Myers added a drawing of his own, and called up some engineers at Bell Laboratories.\r\nBy photographic means, the engineers\u2014Fred Waldhauer and Robert Merkle \u2014 reduced the artists' drawings and etched them in a thin film onto 18 rectangular wafers of ceramic, each three-quarters of an inch long, one-half inch wide and one-fortieth of an inch thick.\r\n[...]\r\nMr. Myers said that all of the drawings were produced especially for the wafer. Mr. Oldenburg's contribution was a geometric mouse, the subject of a sculpture in his current show at the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Warhol's contribution was a calligraphic squiggle made up of the initials of his signature. Mr. Chamberlain did a template pattern, similar to one he used to produce paintings done with automobile lacquer.\r\n[...]\r\nMr. Novros did a black square divided by thin white lines. Mr. Rauschenberg did a wavy line and Mr. Myers himself contributed a computer drawing.\r\n\"It's a great idea,\" Mr. Oldenburg said yesterday, \"and I wish it could have been a more elaborate presentation. In fact it would have been nice if artists had worked with technologists on the design of the lunar module.\"\r\nReflecting on the purported project, Mr. Myers said: \"Now I know that there's a soulful piece of art up there\u2014a piece of software among all that hardware and junk.\"",

I then called a guy in NASA's public relations division in Houston, who seemed optimistic. So we proceeded on the assumption that we could work through regular channels.\"\r\nBut, according to Mr. Myers, permission never came through, and at the last minute, the group decided to go ahead with the project anyway. Mr. Myers sent one of the wafers to a Grumman Aircraft Corporation engineer working at Cape Kennedy, Fla.\r\nAbout a month ago, the engineer is said to have attached the wafer to the hatch of an access port on the Intrepid's leg and then sent a telegram to Mr. Myers confirming the deed. Apparently, the tiny wafer remained unnoticed. The engineer's name was not disclosed.",

American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon... From the 14th until the 24th of November that same year, NASA accomplished another manned flight to the moon. The Apollo 12 mission was organized to collect more seismologic, scientific and technical data and deepen seleonologic observation. This second moon mission was completed by three highly trained astronauts: Alan Bean, Charles \"Pete\" Conrad and Richard Gordon. In the 1960s, NASA began commissioning artists to create art inspired by the Apollo missions.\r\n\"My idea was to get six great artists together and make a tiny little museum that would be on the moon,\" said Forrest \"Frosty\" Myers.  Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Novros, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg and Forrest Myers created images specifically for the Moon Museum project. \"Going to the moon was the biggest thing for our generation...We had stepped off the planet,\" according to Myers. Using thin film photo reduction as with micro-processing, the Moon Museum drawings were printed on ceramic wafers roughly the size of a thumbnail.  With the assistance of an unnamed Grumman employee, one of these chips was surreptitiously attached to the Apollo 12's LEM-6 landing legs and sent it to the moon. The lunar module descended to the lunar surface on November 19, 1969.\r\nPresented for the first time at the Georgian National Museum Dimitri Shevardnadze National Gallery in Tbilisi with Apollo artifacts and including kapton foil and commemorative coins made of metal flown to the Moon, this exhibition features the Moon Museum while expanding the theme with newly commissioned work by several additional prominent contemporary artists.\r\nKonstantin Mindadze's work \"Out of date, time and space\" and On Kawara's \"I am Still Alive\" underline the relevancy of currency and consists of existentialism. Large scale portraits of astronauts created by Rocko Iremashvili precisely reflect real emotions of astronauts and revive the real history. Represented sculptures by Manuchar Okrostsvaridze and Konstantin Mindadze together with Richard Serra's sketches reflect the principles of weight and imponderability.\r\nAddress: Dimitri Shevardnadze National Gallery, 11 Shota Rustaveli Avenue.",

Wanting nothing more than to put something soulful up where typically NASA had left detritus and hardware behind, nearly a half century later, The Moon Museum (with drawings by Rauschenberg, Chamberlain, Oldenburg, Novros, Myers and Warhol) is still a compelling art object and continues to resonate profoundly in the imagination.\r\nFollowing the triumphant return of the Moon Museum from its first blockbuster presentation (an exhibition co-organized by the Bob Rauschenberg Gallery with support from the U.S. Department of State and National Geographic magazine) at the National Gallery of Art in Tbilisi, Georgia (former Soviet Union) last November, the Bob Rauschenberg Gallery at FSW will allow Southwest Florida visitors the rare opportunity to view in-person one of the few original Moon Museum (1969) ceramic tile multiples (along with vintage NASA press photographs, film shot by Apollo XII astronauts and related mission-flown artifacts).",

        "text": "History of the MOON MUSEUM \r\n\tSending a man to the moon in 1969 was the greatest technological feat of my generation. It was one of the rare instances where evolution could be made visible i.e., leaving this planet and stepping onto another celestial body. I had wanted to put an artwork into space ever since the Russians launched the first Sputnik. The 1960\u2019s were exciting times in both science and art. In l969, I was working with an organization called \u2018Experiments in Art and Technology\u2019. EAT, as it was known, was run by the eminent laser physicist, Billy Kluver, who worked at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. Billy and the artist Robert Rauschenberg had the brilliant idea of pairing artists and engineers together, to help artists realize their more technological projects. Hopefully, this collaboration would introduce the engineers to the ways artists worked and thought, thus stimulating a cross-pollination. \r\n\tFor my part, I proposed putting Art on the Moon. Dr. Kluver thought the \u2018Moon Museum\u2019 as I called it, a terrific idea and proposed that we try for the next moon landing, Apollo 12, which was set for lift off the following November 14, 1969. (Apollo 11 was the first landing on the moon and had taken place on July 16, 1969 with Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.) Billy put me in contact with Fred Waldhauer, a Bell Labs engineer, who had helped Robert Rauschenberg on his electric \u2018Combine\u2019 pieces. My piece would consist of six drawings by prominent artists: Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Novros, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg and myself, Forrest Myers (drawings are clockwise from upper left on the chip). It would be reduced onto a small computer chip using tantalum nitrite that was plated onto the chip - a ceramic wafer measuring 1/2 inch high by 3/4 inch long by 1/32 inch thick. Once the chip was finished it would be placed aboard the Lunar Lander that would eventually stay on the surface of the Moon. \r\n\tAlthough Fred Wauldhauer was acting project manager, the \u2018chip / artwork\u2019 was made by two other Bell Lab engineers, Robert Merkle, whose expertise was computer circuitry and Burt Unger, who ran the lab. Printing all six artworks on such a small surface was state of the art engineering in 1969. Using today's technology we could print these drawings on the head of a pin. \r\n\tAs the launch date approached, permission from NASA had not been formalized.  I asked Henry Geldzhellar, who was the Director of American Art at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, if he would come forward on our behalf to obtain permission from NASA. At this point, we would proceed with the project assuming that Henry would be successful in his inquiries. Apollo 12 was the second manned mission on the moon with astronauts Pete Conrad, Richard Gorden and Alan Bean. Fred Waldhauer was in contact with an engineer working on the assembly of the Lunar Lander at Grumman Aircraft out on Long Island. The engineer agreed to place the Art Work aboard the Lander saying that this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. \r\n\tJust days before the launch, permission still had not arrived and the Grumman engineer who was now in Cape Canaveral, Florida said he would just do it anyway and he would send Fred a telegram to that effect.  As it turned out, he sent one to me as well. My telegram reads:  \u201cYour on. A O K All systems are go. John F.\u201d\r\n\tThe next day we had done it! On November 19, 1969 Apollo 12 landed on Oceanus Procell Arum, the \u201cOcean of Storms.\u201d  The \u2018Moon Museum\u2019 was the first Art on the Moon.  Splashdown was successful on November 24, 1969.",

        "text": "Many creatives dedicated their time and artistic energy to making the Moon Museum. Two of those people were Bell Laboratories engineers Bob Merkle and Burt Unger.\r\nBrought into the project by Fred Waldhauer, Bob and Burt were responsible for physically getting the six artist sketches onto the small ceramic chip so it could be affixed to the Apollo 12 Lander and blast to the moon.\r\nTo do so, they used technology available to them at Bell Labs for making microcircuits.\r\nTwelve ceramic chips were made at one time by photo-reducing the six sketches down to the correct size to fit on the chip and then repeating the pattern twelve times.  The twelve identical \u201ccanvases\u201d were then developed onto a piece of glass \u2013 called a mask.\r\nThen, a piece of ceramic the size of the mask was cleaned and prepared by coating it with a thin layer of metallic tantalum nitride, and then a layer of a light sensitive material called photo resist. \r\nThe mask and ceramic were then exposed to light, leaving the mask\u2019s pattern etched onto the ceramic.\r\nHere Bob describes the process as similar to ordinary camera film processing where:\r\n\"1. A metalized ceramic substrate coated with photo resist is akin to \"film\" coated with an emulsion.\r\n2. A patterned glass plate, the patterning element for the ceramic, is akin to a camera lens transferring an image to film.\r\n3. A light source activating the photo-resist coating on the ceramic is akin to activating the emulsion on film.\r\n4. A pattern developed upon the ceramic using a solvent is AKIN to \"developing\" a pattern on film using a solvent.\r\nHere is where the similarity ends:\r\nIn the case of the ceramic, the pattern will exposed the metalized layer to an acid etch removing it to the bare ceramic.  Subsequent cleaning and baking of the remaining metal patterns on the ceramic stabilizes the layer by oxidation and gives it the deep blue color.\r\nIn the case of the camera film, which is called a \"negative\", subsequent processing converts the image into a \"positive\" print, which we can view.\"\r\nAfter making two ceramics \u2013 or twenty four chips (sawed apart with a diamond wheel) Burt says he broke the glass mask to prevent the production of more chips.",

Museum Show is a historical survey exhibition \u2013 or a \u201cmuseum of museums\u201d perhaps \u2013 displaying a comprehensive selection of these highly idiosyncratic, semi-fictional institutions. Presented at Arnolfini in two chapters, beginning with Part 1 from 24 September \u2013 19 November, it will be the first exhibition to chart this particular tendency in contemporary art.\r\nMuseum Show 1 presents museums from across the spectrum of career status, from canonical to emerging, and from around the globe. The exhibition will look at the different interpretations of what a museum can be, whilst charting the methodologies and reasons used by artists for creating their own institutions \u2013 ranging historically from critique directed towards institutions of art, to more contemporary examples that focus their attention towards wider social and political realms of cultural hegemony.\r\nThe exhibition includes museums that employ a classic \u2018museological\u2019 approach, including Marcel Broodthaers\u2019 seminal Mus\u00e9e de l'Art Moderne, D\u00e9partment des Aigles and the absurdity of Bill Burns\u2019 Museum of Safety Gear for Small Animals, through to broader, more conceptual understandings of a museum infrastructure, such as Tom Marioni\u2019s Museum of Conceptual Art \u2013 a functioning bar and an early example of \u2018convivial\u2019 artwork in the US, to the abjection of Stuart Brisley\u2019s Museum of Ordure, or the utopia of Museo Aero Solar \u2013 a floating museum made of thousands of recycled carrier bags.\r\nWorks from the exhibition are also presented at a number of other locations in Bristol. Marko Lulic\u2019s Museum of Revolution is presented at the M Shed across the harbour from Arnolfini, and the World Agriculture Museum is presented at the former Bridewell Police Station. \r\nMuseo Aero Solar, the first \u201cflying museum\u201d, made entirely of used plastic shopping bags, is presented as a mass-participatory event in the Hengrove district of South Bristol on Sunday 9 October.",
